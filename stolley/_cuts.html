        Ultimately, there are production problems that lo-fi technologies are not yet poised to
        solve: vector graphics (at least until the lo-fi SVG standard is natively implemented in
        Internet Explorer) and 3D-modeling are two examples. No browser has native support for
        sound or video, which are accessible only through media players and browser plugins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even lo-fi typography solutions lag behind their hi-fi counterparts, like Flash (whose
        font-embedding capabilities alone drew many in the graphic design community away from HTML
        and CSS). Designing with pure CSS entails limiting oneself to fonts commonly available on
        most operating systems. While there are glimmers of hope that major Web browsers will
        enable <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten" rel="external">support for
        TrueType Web fonts</a> (fonts that can be accessed over the Web without requiring
        installation on an end-user’s computer, as in the case of basic TrueType fonts), for now
        the lo-fi-ish typography tool of choice is <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr"
        rel="external">Scalable Inman Flash Replacement</a> (sIFR, pron. “siffer,” currently in <a
        href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr3" rel="external">version 3</a>). sIFR relies on the
        lo-fi technologies of plain text structured in XHTML and JavaScript and a small, empty
        Flash movie containing only the font a producer wishes to use on a given Web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        With sIFR, if a reader’s browser lacks or has disabled JavaScript or the Flash player, the
        lo-fi CSS styling or simple HTML text will be displayed instead: a dynamic (and
        unobtrusive) improvement over CSS
        <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/revised-image-replacement/" rel="external">image
        replacement techniques</a>—another typography work-around, but which fails in an imageless
        CSS-enabled environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of any hi-fi technology should operate much like sIFR: taking some readily
        available media element or text, and enhancing it with extended functionality for properly
        equipped users—without punishing lesser-equipped users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unobtrusive solutions like sIFR are rare, though. The videos on YouTube, for example, are
        dynamically loaded into a shell Flash movie that contains the controls for playing and
        pausing the video clip. However, if YouTube were to be fully unobtrusive, it would offer
        links in the HTML to movies in different formats (at least until an open, widely supported
        format is available; see “Insist on open standards and formats” below)—not just the
        proprietary Flash Video (.flv) format. In the absence of Flash or JavaScript, YouTube will
        not function, rendering all of its content inaccessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dynamic and unobtrusive lo-fi media player solution like Scott Schiller’s
        <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/" rel="external">SoundManager
        2</a> takes simple HTML links to sound files, and makes them playable on a Web page for
        users with both JavaScript and Flash enabled (in the absence of JavaScript or Flash, users
        are able follow the links and download the sound files for listening in their own media
        player). Users with Flash are rewarded with an enhanced experience; users without Flash
        are none the wiser, and can still experience the audio presented on the page—which is all
        that the page’s producer could have hoped for. In fact, users without Flash have the added
        advantage of being able to download the individual audio files, perhaps for loading onto
        an iPod or other portable audio player.

        Despite all of the open standards for text and images listed above, it’s astounding that
        there are not yet open standards for sound or video. The Ogg media container and its
        Vorbis and Theora CODECs, for sound and video respectively, are both promising solutions
        (especially because they are the preferred media formats on Wikipedia, particularly the
        Wikimedia Commons). Unfortunately, at present, Ogg formats require CODECs to be downloaded
        for use within other media players, adding an extra step beyond downloading Windows Media
        Player, QuickTime, or other audio/video players. (However, there is talk of <a
        href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/06/firefox-3-to-feature-native-audio-video-support/"
        rel="external">native Ogg support within Firefox</a>, meaning that Firefox could play Ogg
        audio without an additional plugin. At present, Firefox is expected to couple this
        functionality with the multimedia-oriented <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/" rel="external">HTML 5 Draft</a>
        specification, which is competing, somewhat, with the W3C’s more XML-like
        structure-oriented <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/" rel="external">XHTML 2 draft
        spec</a>. For a simple overview of HTML 5, see <a
        href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/previewofhtml5/" rel="external">Hunt, 2007</a>.)

        Source literacy holds the key not only to more sustainable and accessible digital
        discourse, but to our ability to substantively contribute to the many open-source
        projects, like Drupal, Moodle, and even Firefox, which would no doubt benefit from the
        expertise and values that members of our field have to share.

        Innovation in the digital medium is not to be found on the paved cow paths of
        point-and-click, template-driven, fill-in-the-blank WYSIWYG software. Indeed, much of the
        exciting work on the Web involves working beyond the relatively simple languages of XHTML
        and CSS; the Application Programming Interface (API) and the Integrated Development
        Environment (IDE) are where the real envelope-pushing action is. But without the kind of
        source literacy gained from basic languages like XHTML, members of our field and our
        students will be wholly unprepared to build or command APIs or function competently in
        IDEs.
