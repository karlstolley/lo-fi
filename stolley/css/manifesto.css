/*

One of the advantages to some lo-fi technologies, like CSS, is that digital
authors can not only execute their discourse or visual design, but leave
behind meaningful, fully human-readable descriptions of the choices made
to bring the discourse or design into being.

And so that's what I've done here: describing the purpose of every single
line of the CSS used in the Lo-Fi Manifesto (with the exception of the
Yahoo! Reset CSS, which basically removes all margin and padding, bolding,
italicizing, etc.)

All of the visual design for the Lo-Fi Manifesto has been achieved in CSS;
the animation effects were done using the MooTools JavaScript library. The
HTML contains only structured content, making it friendly to screen readers,
mobile devices, and even printed pages.

Thanks for taking the time to look at this file. --Karl Stolley, May 2008
