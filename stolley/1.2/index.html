      It's a pretty cringe-worthy experience to re-read my own writing. <i>The Lo-Fi Manifesto</i>
      did not fail in delivering that for me. Here you can read my commentary on the original
      version.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
  <p>
    The time has come to reject expensive consumer and prosumer software that hinders the
    extensibility of digital discourse and limits digital production literacy to programs and file
    formats that are destined for disruptive upgrades or obsolescence.
  </p>
  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      This is an opener that sounds good (<i>The time has come!</i>), but it really doesn’t say
      much. It also makes it sound like if you haven’t adopted lo-fi technologies and approaches,
      there’s no hope for you. But that’s not correct: lo-fi is something that can be chosen at
      any time, with each new project that comes along. It’s never too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the expensive consumer/prosumer stuff is less of a concern than it was; now, I’m more
      preoccupied by hosted stuff beyond users’ control, or monolithic systems that are deployed
      without much exploration of alternatives, things like Drupal and WordPress. Cost is sort of
      beside the point, and constrained budgets have certainly forced the turn to ready
      alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe worst of all, <i>digital discourse</i> is an unnecessary mouthful. It’s writing. Just
      writing. All of it. So call it that. No one is going to come running for help because they
      have detected a problem in their <i>digital discourse</i>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Digital scholars in the loosely defined fields of rhetoric and composition, computers and
    writing, and technical communication should create free and open source artifacts that are
    software- and device-independent. Discourse posted on the open Web can hardly be considered free
    if access requires costly software or particular devices.
  </p>
  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      Ugh, <i>digital scholars...</i>. It makes for a nice self-important pairing with <i>digital
      discourse</i>, doesn’t it? There’s just something so off-putting about that. Maybe it’s the
      original motivation behind this sentence, which was my pursuit of tenure and trying to make
      the argument for digital work as scholarship. But given how far and wide <i>Lo-Fi</i> has
      gone, naming a specific category of people just rings hollow and kind of elitist in ways that
      make me feel embarrassed now.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Additionally, the literacies and language we develop through engaging in digital scholarship and
    knowledge-making should enable us to speak confidently, unambiguously, and critically with one
    another about the intricacies and methods of digital production.
  </p>
  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      ...that <i>digital scholars</i> line sets up the <i>we</i> and <i>us</i> here and throughout
      feel even more like an in-group thing. I’m trying to cut <i>we</i> and <i>us</i> out of my
      writing, anyway. I don’t mean them in the royal sense, and I’ve long since given up trying to
      be a spokesperson for anyone but me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the point of that third paragraph: people still stumble pretty badly over the words
      they need to talk about digital production. I just don’t know, however, if what it takes to
      make sophisticated digital work can be accurately called <i>literacy</i>. Introducing
      terminology like that can make matters worse. <i>Literacy</i> is a familiar, comfortable, and
      high-value word in and around rhetoric and writing studies. But it’s also kind of a binary:
      someone is literate, or not. That’s not useful to me. I’ve come to use <i>learning</i> where I
      would have used <i>literacy</i> in the past, if only because <i>learning</i> doesn’t lend
      itself to that binary. Learning also suggests, at least to me, something that is always
      ongoing. No destination, no minimum or maximum level of competence.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    And as teachers, we should actively work to provide students with sustainable, extensible
    production literacies through open, rhetorically grounded digital practices that emphasize the
    <em>source</em> in “free and open source.”
  </p>
  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      That last paragraph illustrates the really serious weakness of the original <i>Lo-Fi
      Manifesto</i>: it was long on pronouncements, and very short on guidance. I suppose that is
      typical of manifestoes generally, but it feels irresponsible to me now to call out teachers
      and not follow up with some better, actionable specifics. To <i>actively work to
      provide...</i> is about the weakest pedagogical directive I can think of.
    </p>

  <div class="defining-technologies">
  <h2>Defining Lo-fi Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    Lo-fi production technologies are stable and free. They consist of and/or can retrograde to:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Plain text files (.txt, .xml, .htm, .css, .js, etc.)</li>
    <li>Plain text editors (Notepad, TextEdit, pico/nano, vi, etc.)</li>
    <li>Standardized, human-readable forms of open languages expressed in plain text
      (XML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)</li>
    <li>Single-media files (image, audio, video) in open formats</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      This list is still good, although it strikes me that the stuff most obviously needing revision
      is the list of editors. Delicious irony, being burned by the same proprietary software that
      the rest of the manifesto rails against. Windows’ default editor Notepad is almost as bad as
      OS X’s TextEdit. Yes, they are text editors, but no one in their right mind should use them
      except as a desperate last resort. Not now, and not back when the original manifesto came out,
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why did I include them in the first place? Probably just to illustrate that some lo-fi
      tools are already available on most operating systems. (And if you’re cool with command-line
      editors, you’re going to opt for vim, not vi, or Emacs and look down your nose at pico/nano.)
      I’m not certain of the case with newer versions of Windows, but Notepad through at least XP
      was unable even to edit in UTF-8/Unicode. Forget about syntax highlighting. And TextEdit out
      of the box looks more like a word processor (it defaults to Rich Text Format). It takes a lot
      of work to get it to edit plain text in a plain text-way. And even when you can, it too lacks
      syntax highlighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that raises another point I should have mentioned here: lo-fi technologies are modular and
      swappable. They can be described in terms of general categories, rather than solely by brand
      name. Lately I’ve been floating between my old standby BBEdit, vim on the command line, and
      newcomers Atom and Brackets. It’s a good exercise to work across different pieces of software
      for the same project. Sometimes one editor will make obvious a feature that’s really useful,
      but carefully hidden, in another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m also less of an XML fanboy than I used to be. Lighter weight and more forgiving data
      serialization formats, like JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) can do XML’s job without the
      overhead of an XML parser and its preference to shut down in the presence of even a single
      error.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Despite their humble, decades-old base technology (plain text), innovative uses of lo-fi
    technologies can be remarkably hi-fi, as in the case of
    <abbr title="Asychronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr> (whose most famous application may be
    Google’s Gmail service).
  </p>
  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      That paragraph was a big mistake. It was really irresponsible of me to suggest that making
      something like Gmail or working with AJAX is possible with just plain text and an editor.
      Lo-fi production requires a much richer environment for writing and testing, including
      Unix-like operating systems that make it easy to run network services or even a basic web
      server, behind a firewall. The list of technologies here, from that perspective, is pretty
      incomplete.

  <h2>Lo-Fi is
    <abbr class="lo-fi" title="Lossless, Open, Flexible, In(ter)dependent">LOFI</abbr>
  </h2>
  <p>
    “Lo-fi” describes a preferred set of production technologies that digital producers should
    strive to command, but as an acronym, <abbr class="lo-fi" title="Lossless, Open, Flexible,
    In(ter)dependent">LOFI</abbr> outlines four principles of digital production that are essential
    for the advancement, extension, and long-term preservation of digital discourse:
  </p>

  <div class="commentary">
    <p>
      I promised principles in that paragraph, but what follows is really just more technology
      stuff: particular side-effects and outcomes of lo-fi technologies, maybe, but not really any
      principles that go into making things. Everything in the LOFI acronym is an adjective,
      but principles are actually nouns. But that makes sense, because as they are written, these
      are really four qualities of technologies, not production principles.
    </p>
  </div>

  <ul id="lofi-acronym">
    <li>
      <strong>Lossless</strong>: Discourse presented through lo-fi production technologies neither
      degrades nor becomes trapped in the production itself. Text migrates and transforms from a
      single source (e.g., XML, or an application of XML) to any number of other devices and
      artifacts; images, video, and other media elements maintain their integrity as individual
      files that are orchestrated with one another at a reader’s moment of access, not at the
      producer’s moment of File &gt; Import or File &gt; Save.
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          Beyond being a technology point, that treatment of losslessness is misleading. Lossless,
          uncompressed files should be preserved (especially for media elements), but those are
          probably not the same things that should be presented to casual readers. Especially in
          an age of mobile internet access that is still both relatively slow and costly.
        </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Open</strong>: Lo-fi artifacts’ source code and media elements are available for
      inspection, revision, and extension outside the scope of any one piece of production software
      and any one producer. Openness includes and encourages end-user/reader customization and
      repurposing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flexible</strong>: Discourse artfully and rhetorically created with lo-fi production
      technologies can be experienced unobtrusively in multiple ways by different users equipped
      with a wide variety of conventional, mobile, and adaptive devices—all from a single artifact.
      No plugins, special downloads, or device-/reader-specific artifacts are required.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>In(ter)dependent</strong>: Lo-fi production technologies direct orchestration (like a
      recipe), not composition (like a TV dinner), allowing users and their devices full control to
      render (or not) and perhaps repurpose the media elements that constitute a digital artifact.
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          Interstitial parentheses drive me bonkers. I’m sorry that I included them here. It
          should have just been <i>independent</i>. See? It’s better just to pick one, and go with
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That apology out of the way, most of the stuff under Independent could be a part of
          Flexible. It’s really basically the same thing, the way I outlined them here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to genuinely make these items into actual principles that matter to me in 2015, I
          would rewrite this as Learning (not Lossless); Openness (to keep a noun form going, which
          also invites thinking about the quality of openness in general, versus the open/closed
          binary); F can still be Flexible, but as Flexibility in noun form. And Independence can be
          split up between Openness and Flexibility, making room for another principle: Iteration.
          Multiple versions, careful revisions. That might be the most important principle, because
          it ties the other three together and makes pursuit of them possible.

      Quick commentary just on the basic manifesto points, taken together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Points 1, 2, and 3 are saying basically the same thing: Don’t think about production just in
      terms of software that limits too much what you can learn and traps what you make.
    </p>
    <p>Point 4 is just harsh. The running text is even worse.</p>
    <p>
      Point 5 still makes some sense, maybe, but as the now 100%-defunct running text proves, the
      principle isn’t too sound to begin with.

          I'm still a big fan of the Maeda epigraph here. It says what this manifesto point

        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        As rhetoricians, we should resist allowing software, commercial or
        otherwise, to signify entire digital genres. But compare the number
        of results in a search engine for “rhetoric of PowerPoint” versus “rhetoric
        of slideshows.” The results are not encouraging—and suggest that “vendor
        lock-in” has as much of a grip on discourse as it does on scenes of
        production.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          More in-group stuff.The problem of software defining the scope of production is more than
          a single group’s problem. It’s everywhere, for everyone.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        But consider a software-independent, lo-fi alternative to PowerPoint:
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a>, CSS guru and design wizard, developed and
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/category/tech/s5/">released into the public domain</a>
        a <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">Simple Standards-based Slide Show System</a>
        (S5). Meyer’s system uses the lo-fi technologies of structural XHTML, media-specific CSS,
        and JavaScript (languages usually encountered on Web pages) to deploy slideshows. Unlike
        PowerPoint slideshows, which require either the PowerPoint software itself or the
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=048DC840-14E1-467D-8DCA-19D2A8FD7485&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer</a>
        for optimal viewing, S5 slideshows function in any modern web browser.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          S5 is still a viable project, with even more impressive lo-fi-style systems available,
          like Reveal.js.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A lo-fi system like S5 is well suited to the rhetorical situation of the slideshow, whose
        defining characteristic is uncertainty. Slideshows are commonly projected on unfamiliar
        computers (often, it seems, with dubious maintenance records) that a speaker might have
        access to only shortly before speaking. Will that computer have PowerPoint installed? The
        right version of PowerPoint, at that? If not, will the logged-in user have sufficient
        privileges and a network connection to download the PowerPoint viewer? If all else fails,
        will a reasonably competent IT person be present to step in and help?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such problems, rooted in the inflexible digital materiality of the PowerPoint file itself,
        are easily avoided by lo-fi alternatives like S5: even if the computer runs an outmoded
        browser (and what computer doesn’t have a browser installed?), S5 or other lo-fi
        slideshows will operate more or less as planned—while still being editable (something not
        possible in the bundled player-slideshow .pps format of PowerPoint). Speakers can even
        keep their slideshow and a
        <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">portable version of Firefox</a>
        on their USB drives (or CD-ROMs, as some über-paranoid computer security policies restrict
        access to USB ports.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The move away from the seeming inevitability of software like PowerPoint or Flash brings
        the aims of the digital genre itself into focus: a much more flexible, rhetorical approach
        to production than focusing on the features and limitations of a given piece of software.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          Those closing three paragraphs are probably some of the most solid stuff in the manifesto.
          Although it's getting harder to find computers that still have optical drives in them, the
          rest of the concerns here are true. They just don't go far enough: it's not just
          slideshows that have these troubles, but any device anywhere that's opening someone else's
          work.

          I will always like Alan Kay and this epigraphy, but as I mentioned earlier, I have not
          scene <i>literacy</i> work the magic I thought it would in motivating people to learn
          new things. Learning is really what is at stake.

      </div>
      <p>
        Acts of digital production should contribute to a deeper literacy than learning to point
        and click through an arbitrary set of menus and dialog boxes. Production literacies of
        point-and-click, menu-driven WYSIWYG software are not extensible: beyond exposing users to
        certain visual conventions (clicking a 3.5-inch floppy disk icon to save? really?),
        learning to navigate Microsoft Word has little bearing on future efforts in PhotoShop or
        Flash, much less CSS or MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adobe’s
        <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html">announcement</a>
        in spring of 2005 that it had purchased Macromedia—the company behind Flash, Dreamweaver,
        and other web production software—should have raised serious questions about producing and
        teaching too closely with particular software technologies, which can potentially evaporate
        as quickly as the ink dries on a corporate merger.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          Flash is basically dead now. At least the format is, even though Adobe plans to push
          ahead with an HTML5-based version of the software. Good luck with that.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Yet even adopting community-developed, open-source software is not necessarily the best
        response to the inherent instability of corporate software packages. True, the digital
        production literacies learned through open-source software, like
        <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>, may be less prone to
        corporate mergers (though not necessarily corporate buyouts—witness
        <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html">Sun Microsystems’ purchase of MySQL</a>,
        arguably the most popular open-source database). But community-developed software, like the
        corporate counterparts it often mimics, does not inherently provide for an “under the hood”
        literate encounter with the materiality of digital production languages and formats that
        lo-fi production methods do. Lo-fi operates at the material level of technology (code);
        WYSIWYG software (which describes Web editors as much as word processors, page design tools,
        etc.) keeps code and file formats at arm’s length by design.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          The bigger issue that goes unstated here is that WYSIWYG is a concept that originated with
          trying to make the onscreen representation of a printed document look the same as the
          printed document itself. WYSIWYG is often championed for its supposed user-friendliness,
          but its status as a relic of print culture should not go unnoticed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Put another way, lo-fi production methods open access to the languages that visual
        interfaces for digital production often obscure: no matter what producers have to do to
        order Dreamweaver around, chances are that Dreamweaver will be spitting out the same (bad)
        code it always has.
      </p>
      <p>
        Production literacies anchored to open, standardized languages have a longer shelf-life
        than those tied to WYSIWYG software. Although languages, like software, are subject to
        future versions, languages often retain much of their essential character (e.g., SGML,
        HTML, and XML look and behave very similarly—despite the fact that SGML was
        <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16387">standardized in 1986</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/hist2002">XML in 2000</a>). Code written in
        earlier versions of a language are often viable even after a revision of the language:
        producers can still write HTML 4.01, even though XHTML 1.0 is preferable. But forget about

        The stability of languages is due, in part, to common ancestors. For example, there are
        few scripting languages that are not at least influenced by C/C++. Learning one language
        on a family tree prepares one to more readily learn others. Even languages that are
        essentially unrelated (say, CSS and PHP, or HTML and Ruby) share much of the same meta
        vocabulary: lines of styles in CSS must be <strong>terminated</strong>, as must lines of
        PHP code. <strong>Nested</strong> tags in HTML resemble statements that are
        <strong>nested</strong> in Ruby. Prepared with this sort of vocabulary, digital producers
        can develop mental models for how languages operate. They can even leverage exacting
        Google searches to solve a wide range of production problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developer communities are the other component of a language’s stability. Multiple active
        developer communities surround any given open language: not just in the language’s use,
        but in its development (e.g., <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP.net</a>).
        As digital producers develop proficiency in a language, they may be able to shape the
        language’s future development. Such is the case with PHP, and in smaller, localized
        applications of languages, like microformats. Production literacies should aim to prepare
        digital producers to talk back to and shape the communities and technologies supporting
        digital discourse.

      <p>
        Too many software programs create “roach motels” for content and information: the data
        checks in (via File &gt; Import), but it never checks out. Such digital artifacts—the
        PowerPoint, the PDF—are only marginal improvements over the entrapped quality of
        analog/print information; and in some ways (e.g., dependence on a specific piece of
        software to view the artifact) are actually steps backward from the comparatively open
        access that books and other printed matter provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The selfishness of closed, roach-motel formats and WYSIWYG software is implicit in the
        acronym: What YOU See is What YOU Get. As though YOU, the producer, were the only one who
        mattered in the digital rhetorical situation (<em>if it looks good for me in Dreamweaver
        or FrontPage</em>, so the logic goes, <em>it must look good everywhere for everyone</em>).
        In a time when screens range between postage-stamp-sized cell phones and 71-inch flat
        panel LCDs, it is lunacy to assume that what the producer sees is what everyone, indeed
        <em>anyone</em>, else sees. Thoughtful digital producers should be much more concerned
        about what audience members GET than what they SEE.
      </p>
      <p>
        What audiences should get is flexible, open discourse. The Web and even the
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> are efforts steeped in the
        promise of such openness. But a Creative Commons (CC) license that allows for derivative
        works of, say, a Web-available Flash movie is an oxymoron at best (just try to extract an
        image from a Flash movie). At worst, the CC license emphasizes gestures of openness over
        interrogating the materiality of technologies and their capacity to support derivative
        discourse.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          That paragraph is as true as ever. Licensing really is only one small piece of the puzzle
          of making something more open.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        To genuinely make digital discourse friendly to derivative works, it needs to be much more
        flexible (cut and paste does not count). Ultimately, end users and their devices should be
        responsible for combining content of different media elements—not software or file formats
        like Flash, and really not producers, either. The producer’s responsibility is to
        reference and orchestrate elements that can be accessed in a combined or piecemeal
        fashion: only then is a CC derivative-works license viable, or even honest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any given digital artifact needs to be constructed not as a final resting place for
        discourse, but as a pause in a stream of further, unfettered access. A Web page listing an
        organization’s members’ names and email addresses, for example, can be far more open
        through the use of <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>.
        Rather than cutting and pasting the contents of the page, or returning each time the
        page’s information is needed, a user can, via the presence of
        <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">the hCard microformat</a> and a
        technology like
        <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4106">Operator</a>, import some or all of
        the membership’s contact information directly into her own email address book. Once email
        address books become microformat-friendly, the address book could query the URL containing
        the contact information and update entries automatically.

          Burned again by specific software. Operator used to be a pretty great plugin on Firefox,
          but it has since gone to rot and I just get sad thinking about it. The Chrome version
          seems to be okay, at least. But the more important thing to note here is that microformats
          are now part of the HTML5 specification. There is always a worthwhile distinction between
          the stability of thing you can write yourself with source code and plain text, and the
          specific piece of software used to access it.

        Single-sourcing with lo-fi XML technologies and their microformat cousins is an
        unprecedented and unparalleled method to structure and openly share content. But
        dependence on WYSIWYG software has kept producers in our field and elsewhere largely
        ignorant of XML. Even the XML backbone to OpenOffice.org’s implementation of the Open
        Document Type (ODT) format is a limited use of XML. OpenOffice.org (OOo) appears to do to
        XML what FrontPage and Dreamweaver have done to HTML: hacking up the language to
        accommodate visual choices (XML is a structural, not visual, markup language), and
        needlessly complicating what ought to be human-readable code into something meaningful
        only to machines.

          Ah, single-sourcing. The content manager’s pipe-dream of the 2000s. Turns out that it is

        worse, to announce that their equipment (and, perhaps, by extension, financial status or

        begging for forgiveness (readers just go elsewhere): posting unusual file types to email

          Some good points here, buried in amongst all the drama of people begging for forgiveness.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Producers deserve no forgiveness for their technological shortcomings or ignorance. None.
        A poor technological choice that denies access to anyone, for any reason, is ultimately a
        rhetorical problem—particularly when there are lo-fi technologies, like valid XHTML, that
        inherently address issues of access. The time has come to hold our colleagues and students
        accountable for their technological choices just as they would be held accountable for any
        other rhetorical choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not about elitism; it is about raising our expectations of one another to embrace
        and take responsibility for <em>all</em> of the rhetorical concerns that comprise the
        digital medium—not just those that are easy, obvious, or convenient. So long as producers
        are relieved of their responsibilities, either by their audience or by the false
        assurances of WYSIWYG software, digital production will only attend to the question of
        “How to do this?” when the question ought to be, “How to do this <em>best</em>?”
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          Actually, I’m pretty sure this is about elitism. This whole section feels like such a
          missed opportunity to do some good and offer some help and guidance.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Lo-fi production technologies are able to deliver artifacts that are editable everywhere,
        and accessible everywhere, too (at least to some extent). Rather than developing
        after-the-fact alternative content (e.g., to make up for a missing Flash movie), producing
        and inventing in lo-fi technologies addresses the essential need for users to access
        content regardless of their conditions, including physical ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producing accessibile digital artifacts is neither an end in itself nor a testament to the
        supremacy of technology over all other rhetorical concerns. Rather, accessible artifacts
        arise from the equal application of care and attention to detail that scholars, in
        particular, expect of content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers of accessible, lo-fi artifacts will appreciate not being told what they must do
        (even if they are left blissfully ignorant of the enhanced coolness they may be missing
        out on); and producers can develop content and ideas in far less taxing lo-fi environments
        (compared to Flash), in far more portable and extensible formats, like XML, with far
        greater confidence in audience access than WYSIWYG software could ever provide.

        Ultimately, there are production problems that lo-fi technologies are not yet poised to
        solve: vector graphics (at least until the lo-fi SVG standard is natively implemented in
        Internet Explorer) and 3D-modeling are two examples. No browser has native support for

          SVG is here, and there are no shortages of polyfills for it, not to mention good-old image
          fallbacks for the few remaining browsers in use that don’t support it. WebGL and other
          standards are making 3D rendering possible. Even CSS3 has entire 3D tranform and

        Even lo-fi typography solutions lag behind their hi-fi counterparts, like Flash (whose
        font-embedding capabilities alone drew many in the graphic design community away from HTML
        and CSS). Designing with pure CSS entails limiting oneself to fonts commonly available on
        most operating systems. While there are glimmers of hope that major Web browsers will
        enable <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten">support for TrueType Web fonts</a>
        (fonts that can be accessed over the Web without requiring installation on an end-user’s
        computer, as in the case of basic TrueType fonts), for now the lo-fi-ish typography tool of
        choice is
        <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr">Scalable Inman Flash Replacement</a> (sIFR,
        pron. “siffer,” currently in <a href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr3">version 3</a>). sIFR
        relies on the lo-fi technologies of plain text structured in XHTML and JavaScript and a
        small, empty Flash movie containing only the font a producer wishes to use on a given Web
        page.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          CSS <code>@font-face</code> is now widely supported, and works in tandem with the original
          <code>font-family</code> property to make rich web typography a reality. Licensing is the
          primary issue, which is why services like Google Fonts, Adobe Typekit, and Fonts.com are
          so popular (that, and they prepare the font-face stacks for you).
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        With sIFR, if a reader’s browser lacks or has disabled JavaScript or the Flash player, the
        lo-fi CSS styling or simple HTML text will be displayed instead: a dynamic (and
        unobtrusive) improvement over CSS
        <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/revised-image-replacement/">image replacement techniques</a>—another
        typography work-around, but which fails in an imageless CSS-enabled environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of any hi-fi technology should operate much like sIFR: taking some readily
        available media element or text, and enhancing it with extended functionality for properly
        equipped users—without punishing lesser-equipped users.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">

          Maybe. But really, the lesson now is to keep looking for a lo-fi approach to production.
          Something that seems inevitable and hi-fi only one day will be pretty quickly replaced
          with an open, lo-fi counterpart.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Unobtrusive solutions like sIFR are rare, though. The videos on YouTube, for example, are
        dynamically loaded into a shell Flash movie that contains the controls for playing and
        pausing the video clip. However, if YouTube were to be fully unobtrusive, it would offer
        links in the HTML to movies in different formats (at least until an open, widely supported
        format is available; see “Insist on open standards and formats” below)—not just the
        proprietary Flash Video (.flv) format. In the absence of Flash or JavaScript, YouTube will
        not function, rendering all of its content inaccessible.

        that the page’s producer could have hoped for. In fact, users without Flash have the added

        (especially because they are the preferred media formats on Wikipedia, particularly the

        for use within other media players, adding an extra step beyond downloading Windows Media

          Yeah, no. Most developers are not going to go to the specifications documents as part
          of the routine research needed to write HTML and so on. Community-maintained documentation
          at WebPlatform.org and the Mozilla Developer Network is a much more friendly and useful
          resource. Save the specifications documents for settling nerdy barroom bets.

        Innovation in the digital medium is not to be found on the paved cow paths of
        point-and-click, template-driven, fill-in-the-blank WYSIWYG software. Indeed, much of the
        exciting work on the Web involves working beyond the relatively simple languages of XHTML
        and CSS; the Application Programming Interface (API) and the Integrated Development
        Environment (IDE) are where the real envelope-pushing action is. But without the kind of
        source literacy gained from basic languages like XHTML, members of our field and our
        students will be wholly unprepared to build or command APIs or function competently in
        IDEs.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">

          I regret putting in anything about IDEs. I did that because the original, nameless
          Reviewer #2 of the manifesto made it a point to scold me about how important IDEs are.
          Well, Reviewer #2, you were wrong, and I was a sucker for heeding your advice. Yes, there
          are plenty of IDEs in the world, some of which you absolutely must use (like Xcode to
          build Apple iOS and OS X applications). But for most other things, bring your own text
          editor, your own version control system, and your own modular development and testing
          environment. Languages like Ruby demonstrate that you don't need an IDE and probably will
          be much happier without one.

        Source literacy holds the key not only to more sustainable and accessible digital
        discourse, but to our ability to substantively contribute to the many open-source
        projects, like Drupal, Moodle, and even Firefox, which would no doubt benefit from the
        expertise and values that members of our field have to share.
      </p>
      <div class="commentary">
        <p>
          I still like that idea. I don’t think it’s likely to happen though, at least until there
          is widespread respect for the expertise and values that drive those communities already,
          without some kind of priest-like intercession that I appear to be calling for here.
