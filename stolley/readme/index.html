<p>
It’s sort of a funny idea to revisit the <i>The Lo-Fi Manifesto</i>. The whole point of it was to be choosy about technologies and production methods that are as resistant to change as can be reasonably known.
</p>
<p>
And in that regard, the manifesto and its six original points have held up nicely over the last 8 years. I still stand behind them. Most of the links that I pointed to at the time have held up; an automated audit using <code>wget</code> on November 23, 2015 reported two broken links (the Sun acquisition of MySQL, and the sIFR project, which is no more) in the original at <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/stolley/">http://kairos.&#8203;technorhetoric.net/&#8203;12.3/&#8203;topoi/&#8203;stolley/</a>.
</p>

<p>
So, what to do with this piece? At the very lowest end, I could fix some gaffes in the code that have bugged me for years. I could modernize the markup and bring it from XHTML 1.0 Strict into the glorious new future of HTML5. And that would be fine.
</p>

<p>
I could go a bit further and get rid of the stupid, embarrassing, look-what-I-can-do! usability nightmare accordion that toggles the full text of each manifesto point in the most frustrating way possible. I could also realize that in an age of high-density (“retina”) displays that the old green-screen style image no longer has a place—especially on mobile displays which, for performance reasons, don’t support <code>background-position: fixed</code> on background images in CSS anyway. Without <code>background-position: fixed</code>, the green-screen image flickers and looks like a mistake. Which, it pretty much is a mistake anymore. OK, done.
</p>

<p>
I could also just realize a modified design, one that’s a little less literal about the green-screen terminal aesthetic of the original. It’s more than a little off-putting, and probably confirms people’s worst fears that a lo-fi authoring approach means surrendering every last aesthetic nicety afforded by an age of 64-bit color depth, high-density displays, and GPUs that have as much power as CPUs of just a few years ago. I could also remove the faux source-code embellishments on the text, and go with something a little more honest with plain text c. 2016, namely the Markdown syntax. If someone wanted their fill of source-code comments, they can do what the original one itself invited: look at the source code for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
That would be a nice visual revision of the original. But would anyone really want to re-read it again? Maybe I could also go line-by-line through the manifesto, and provide commentary and additional thoughts on some of the ideas contained within it. Issue some apologies for places where I was kind of mean. After all, I wrote the piece just as I was finishing graduate school and starting my first job as a new assistant professor. You can probably tell.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps then I could then take that commentary, and revise the original manifesto to better reflect how it would read if I addressed the same basic group of ideas and wrote them for 2016. That would also rework some of the clunky writing and fire-and-brimstone tone that, like some of the code gaffes, have irked me for a long time.
</p>

<p>
From there, I could do a rewrite or like an expanded edition of the manifesto to include a few things, like version control, that were just beyond the horizon of my own learning and development at the time that I wrote the original. I could also add in the biggest thing lacking in the original: some actual pedagogical guidance, beyond vague declarations to “provide students” with some approach or technology or another.
</p>

<h2>All of the Above</h2>

<p>
But, this is an Inventio webtext appearing in Kairos. I don’t have to pick any one of those approaches to revisit the Lo-Fi Manifesto: I can pick them all. And that’s exactly what I did.
</p>

<h2>Any Version You Like</h2>
<p>
There are multiple different versions of <i>The Lo-Fi Manifesto</i> here; their version numbers roughly follow the principles of Semantic Versioning (that explains the leap from 1.0.3 to 1.1.0, and 1.1.0 to 2.0.0)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.0.0: The glob of recovered notes and files that I found on an old hard drive</li>
  <li>0.0.1: The original webtext as submitted to Kairos for review</li>
  <li>0.1.0: The original webtext, with its number-versioned files (e.g., <code>index-old-7.html</code>) presented as a series of after-the-fact commits</li>
  <li>1.0.0: The unaltered, as-published original webtext.</li>
  <li>1.0.1: A corrected original, mostly fixing minor errors.</li>
  <li>1.0.2: An improved original, in terms of a mobile-friendly, responsive design and better typography.</li>
  <li>1.1.0: Paragraph-by-paragraph commentary on the original</li>
  <li>2.0.0: A rebooted Lo-Fi Manifesto for the next decade and beyond</li>
</ul>
