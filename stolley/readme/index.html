<p>
  It’s sort of a funny idea to revisit the <i>The Lo-Fi Manifesto</i>. The whole point of it was to
  be choosy about technologies and production methods that are as resistant to change as can be
  reasonably known.
</p>
<p>
  And in that regard, the manifesto and its six original points have held up nicely over the last 8
  years. Substantively speaking, I still stand behind them. Most of the links that I pointed to at
  the time have held up; an automated audit using <code>wget</code> on November 23, 2015,  reported
  two broken links (the Sun acquisition of MySQL, and the sIFR project, which is no more) in the
  original at <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/stolley/">http://kairos.&#8203;technorhetoric.net/&#8203;12.3/&#8203;topoi/&#8203;stolley/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  So, what to do with this piece? At the very lowest end, I could fix some gaffes in the code that
  have bugged me for years. I could modernize the markup and bring it from XHTML 1.0 Strict into the
  glorious new future of HTML5. And that would be fine.
</p>
<p>
  I could also create a modified design, one that’s a little less literal about the
  green-screen terminal aesthetic of the original. It’s more than a little off-putting, and probably
  confirms people’s worst fears that a lo-fi authoring approach means surrendering every last
  aesthetic nicety afforded by an age of 64-bit color depth, high-density displays, and GPUs that
  have as much power as CPUs of just a few years ago. A new design would lose the
  usability-nightmare accordion design of the original. It would also see the removal of the faux
  source-code embellishments on the text, and replace them with something a little more common to
  plain text c. 2016, namely the Markdown syntax. If people want to look at source-code comments,
  they can do what the original manifesto itself invited: look at the source code for the HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  That would make for a nice visual revision of the original. But would anyone really want to
  re-read it again? Maybe for the reboot, I could also read through the manifesto, and provide
  commentary and additional thoughts on some of the ideas contained within it. Issue some apologies
  for places where I was kind of mean. After all, I wrote the piece just as I was finishing graduate
  school and starting my first job as a new assistant professor. You can probably tell.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps I could then take that commentary, and revise the original manifesto to better reflect how
  it would read if I addressed the same basic group of ideas and wrote them for 2016.  I could do a
  rewrite of the manifesto to include a few things, like version control, that were just beyond the
  horizon of my own learning and development at the time that I wrote the original. That would also
  give me an opportunity to rework some of the clunky writing and fire-and-brimstone tone that, like
  some of the code gaffes, have irked me for a long time.
</p>
<p>
  But, this is an Inventio webtext appearing in Kairos. I don’t have to pick any one of those
  approaches to revisit the Lo-Fi Manifesto: I can pick them all. And that’s exactly what I did.

<h2 id="versions">Any Version You Like</h2>
<p>
  There are multiple versions of <i>The Lo-Fi Manifesto</i> presented in this new edition. Their
  version numbers roughly follow the principles of <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
  Versioning</a> (that explains the leap from 1.0.1 to 1.1.0, and 1.2.0 to 2.0.0). The 1.0.0 version
  points to the original URL on Kairos. The 0.0.x versions are available only on GitHub, in their
  respective branches, or by cloning the copy of the repository included in the Kairos server. Just
  copy and paste this whole line into your terminal (some of it may be hidden from view):
</p>
<pre class="snippit">$ <code>git clone http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/lo-fi.git</code></pre>
<p>
  The specific differences version to version are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/karlstolley/lo-fi/tree/v0.0.0/stolley">0.0.0</a>: The glob of recovered notes and original authoring files that I found on an old hard drive</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/karlstolley/lo-fi/tree/v0.0.1/stolley">0.0.1</a>: The original webtext, with its number-versioned files (e.g., <code>index-old-7.html</code>) presented as <a href="https://github.com/karlstolley/lo-fi/commits/v0.0.1">a series of after-the-fact commits</a></li>
  <li><a href="//kairos.technorhetoric.net/12.3/topoi/stolley/">1.0.0</a>: The as-published original Lo-Fi Manifesto webtext</li>
  <li><a href="../1.0.1/">1.0.1</a>: A corrected original, mostly fixing minor typographic and source-code errors</li>
  <li><a href="../1.1/">1.1.0</a>: An improved original, in terms of a mobile-friendly, responsive design and better typography.</li>
  <li><a href="../1.2/">1.2.0</a>: The improved original with embedded commentary throughout</li>
  <li><a href="../">2.0.0</a>: A rebooted Lo-Fi Manifesto for the next decade and beyond</li>
</ul>
