  <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
  <p>The time has come to reject expensive consumer and prosumer software that
    hinders the extensibility of digital discourse and limits digital production
    literacy to programs and file formats that are destined for disruptive upgrades
    or obsolescence.</p>
  <p>Digital scholars in the loosely defined fields of rhetoric and composition,
    computers and writing, and technical communication should create free and
    open source artifacts that are software- and device-independent. Discourse
    posted on the open Web can hardly be considered free if access requires costly
    software or particular devices.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the literacies and language we develop through engaging in
    digital scholarship and knowledge-making should enable us to speak confidently,
    unambiguously, and critically with one another about the intricacies and
    methods of digital production.</p>
  <p>And as teachers, we should actively work to provide students with sustainable,
    extensible production literacies through open, rhetorically grounded digital
    practices that emphasize the <em>source</em> in “free and open source.”</p>

  <h2>Defining Lo-fi Technologies</h2>
  <p>Lo-fi production technologies are stable and free. They consist of and/or
    can retrograde to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Plain text files (.txt, .xml, .htm, .css, .js, etc.)</li>
    <li>Plain text editors (Notepad, TextEdit, pico/nano, vi, etc.)</li>
    <li>Standardized, human-readable forms of open languages expressed in plain
      text (XML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)</li>

    <li>Single-media files (image, audio, video) in open formats</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Despite their humble, decades-old base technology (plain text), innovative
    uses of lo-fi technologies can be remarkably hi-fi, as in the case of <acronym title="Asychronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</acronym> (whose
    most famous application may be Google’s Gmail service).</p>
  <h2>Lo-fi is <acronym class="lo-fi" title="Lossless, Open, Flexible, In(ter)dependent">LOFI</acronym></h2>
  <p>“Lo-fi” describes a preferred set of production technologies that digital
    producers should strive to command, but as an acronym, <acronym class="lo-fi" title="Lossless, Open, Flexible, In(ter)dependent">LOFI</acronym> outlines
    four principles of digital production that are essential for the advancement,
    extension, and long-term preservation of digital discourse:</p>

  <ul id="lofi-acronym">
    <li><strong>Lossless</strong>: Discourse presented through lo-fi production
      technologies neither degrades nor becomes trapped in the production itself.
      Text migrates and transforms from a single source (e.g., XML, or an application
      of XML) to any number of other devices and artifacts; images, video, and
      other media elements maintain their integrity as individual files that
      are orchestrated with one another at a reader’s moment of access, not at
      the producer’s moment of File &gt; Import or File &gt; Save.</li>
    <li><strong>Open</strong>: Lo-fi artifacts’ source code and media elements
      are available for inspection, revision, and extension outside the scope
      of any one piece of production software and any one producer. Openness
      includes and encourages end-user/reader customization and repurposing.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible</strong>: Discourse artfully and rhetorically created
      with lo-fi production technologies can be experienced unobtrusively in
      multiple ways by different users equipped with a wide variety of conventional,
      mobile, and adaptive devices—all from a single artifact. No plugins, special
      downloads, or device-/reader-specific artifacts are required.</li>

    <li><strong>In(ter)dependent</strong>: Lo-fi production technologies direct
      orchestration (like a recipe), not composition (like a TV dinner), allowing
      users and their devices full control to render (or not) and perhaps repurpose
      the media elements that constitute a digital artifact.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Manifesto</h2>
  <dl id="manifesto-points">
    <dt>1. Software is a poor organizing principle for digital production.</dt>
    <dd>
      <div>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“What program do you use?” is a question I often get about the slides
            I use to present my work. I have concluded that the proper answer
            to the question is to counter-suggest the asking of a different question,
            “What <em>principle</em> do you use?” <cite><span>John Maeda,</span> The
            Laws of Simplicity</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As rhetoricians, we should resist allowing software, commercial or
          otherwise, to signify entire digital genres. But compare the number
          of results in a search engine for “rhetoric of PowerPoint” versus “rhetoric
          of slideshows.” The results are not encouraging—and suggest that “vendor
          lock-in” has as much of a grip on discourse as it does on scenes of
          production.</p>
        <p>But consider a software-independent, lo-fi alternative to PowerPoint: <a href="http://meyerweb.com/" rel="external">Eric
            Meyer</a>, CSS guru and design wizard, developed and <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/category/tech/s5/" rel="external">released
            into the public domain</a> a <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/" rel="external">Simple
            Standards-based Slide Show System</a> (S5). Meyer’s system uses the
            lo-fi technologies of structural XHTML, media-specific CSS, and JavaScript
            (languages usually encountered on Web pages) to deploy slideshows.
            Unlike PowerPoint slideshows, which require either the PowerPoint
            software itself or the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=048DC840-14E1-467D-8DCA-19D2A8FD7485&amp;displaylang=en" rel="external">Microsoft
            PowerPoint Viewer</a> for optimal viewing, S5 slideshows function
            in any modern web browser.</p>

        <p>A lo-fi system like S5 is well suited to the rhetorical situation
          of the slideshow, whose defining characteristic is uncertainty. Slideshows
          are commonly projected on unfamiliar computers (often, it seems, with
          dubious maintenance records) that a speaker might have access to only
          shortly before speaking. Will that computer have PowerPoint installed?
          The right version of PowerPoint, at that? If not, will the logged-in
          user have sufficient privileges and a network connection to download
          the PowerPoint viewer? If all else fails, will a reasonably competent
          IT person be present to step in and help?</p>
        <p>Such problems, rooted in the inflexible digital materiality of the
          PowerPoint file itself, are easily avoided by lo-fi alternatives like
          S5: even if the computer runs an outmoded browser (and what computer
          doesn’t have a browser installed?), S5 or other lo-fi slideshows will
          operate more or less as planned—while still being editable (something
          not possible in the bundled player-slideshow .pps format of PowerPoint).
          Speakers can even keep their slideshow and a <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" rel="external">portable
          version of Firefox</a> on their USB drives (or CD-ROMs, as some über-paranoid
          computer security policies restrict access to USB ports.)</p>
        <p>The move away from the seeming inevitability of software like PowerPoint
          or Flash brings the aims of the digital genre itself into focus: a
          much more flexible, rhetorical approach to production than focusing
          on the features and limitations of a given piece of software.</p>
      </div>
    </dd>
    <dt>2. Digital literacy should reach beyond the limitations of software.</dt>

    <dd>
      <div>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The ability to “read” a medium means you can <em>access</em> materials
            and tools created by others. The ability to “write” in a medium means
            you can <em>generate</em> materials and tools for others. You must
            have both to be literate. <cite class="article" title="Page 125"><span>Alan
            Kay,</span> “User Interface: A Personal View”</cite></p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Acts of digital production should contribute to a deeper literacy
          than learning to point and click through an arbitrary set of menus
          and dialog boxes. Production literacies of point-and-click, menu-driven
          WYSIWYG software are not extensible: beyond exposing users to certain
          visual conventions (clicking a 3.5-inch floppy disk icon to save? really?),
          learning to navigate Microsoft Word has little bearing on future efforts
          in PhotoShop or Flash, much less CSS or MySQL.</p>
        <p>Adobe’s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html" rel="external">announcement</a> in
          spring of 2005 that it had purchased Macromedia—the company behind
          Flash, Dreamweaver, and other web production software—should have raised
          serious questions about producing and teaching too closely with particular
          software technologies, which can potentially evaporate as quickly as
          the ink dries on a corporate merger.</p>
        <p>Yet even adopting community-developed, open-source software is not
          necessarily the best response to the inherent instability of corporate
          software packages. True, the digital production literacies learned
          through open-source software, like <a href="http://openoffice.org/" rel="external">OpenOffice.org</a>,
          may be less prone to corporate mergers (though not necessarily corporate
          buyouts—witness <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html" rel="external">Sun
          Microsystems’ purchase of MySQL</a>, arguably the most popular open-source
          database). But community-developed software, like the corporate counterparts
          it often mimics, does not inherently provide for an “under the hood”
          literate encounter with the materiality of digital production languages
          and formats that lo-fi production methods do. Lo-fi operates at the
          material level of technology (code); WYSIWYG software (which describes
          Web editors as much as word processors, page design tools, etc.) keeps
          code and file formats at arm’s length by design.</p>

        <p>Put another way, lo-fi production methods open access to the languages
          that visual interfaces for digital production often obscure: no matter
          what producers have to do to order Dreamweaver around, chances are
          that Dreamweaver will be spitting out the same (bad) code it always
          has.</p>
        <p>Production literacies anchored to open, standardized languages have
          a longer shelf-life than those tied to WYSIWYG software. Although languages,
          like software, are subject to future versions, languages often retain
          much of their essential character (e.g., SGML, HTML, and XML look and
          behave very similarly—despite the fact that SGML was <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16387" rel="external">standardized
          in 1986</a>, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/hist2002" rel="external">XML in 2000</a>).
          Code written in earlier versions of a language are often viable even
          after a revision of the language: producers can still write HTML 4.01,
          even though XHTML 1.0 is preferable. But forget about trying to pass
          a Word 1.0 document around.</p>
        <p>The stability of languages is due, in part, to common ancestors. For
          example, there are few scripting languages that are not at least influenced
          by C/C++. Learning one language on a family tree prepares one to more
          readily learn others. Even languages that are essentially unrelated
          (say, CSS and PHP, or HTML and Ruby) share much of the same meta vocabulary:
          lines of styles in CSS must be <strong>terminated</strong>, as must
          lines of PHP code. <strong>Nested</strong> tags in HTML resemble statements
          that are <strong>nested</strong> in Ruby. Prepared with this sort of
          vocabulary, digital producers can develop mental models for how languages
          operate. They can even leverage exacting Google searches to solve a
          wide range of production problems.</p>

        <p>Developer communities are the other component of a language’s stability.
          Multiple active developer communities surround any given open language:
          not just in the language’s use, but in its development (e.g., <a href="http://www.php.net/" rel="external">PHP.net</a>).
          As digital producers develop proficiency in a language, they may be
          able to shape the language’s future development. Such is the case with
          PHP, and in smaller, localized applications of languages, like microformats.
          Production literacies should aim to prepare digital producers to talk
          back to and shape the communities and technologies supporting digital
          discourse.</p>

          <p>In an extreme view, the world can be seen as only connections, nothing
            else.<cite title="Page 12"> <span>Tim Berners-Lee,</span> Weaving
            the Web</cite></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Too many software programs create “roach motels” for content and information:
          the data checks in (via File &gt; Import), but it never checks out.
          Such digital artifacts—the PowerPoint, the PDF—are only marginal improvements
          over the entrapped quality of analog/print information; and in some
          ways (e.g., dependence on a specific piece of software to view the
          artifact) are actually steps backward from the comparatively open access
          that books and other printed matter provide.</p>
        <p>The selfishness of closed, roach-motel formats and WYSIWYG software
          is implicit in the acronym: What YOU See is What YOU Get. As though
          YOU, the producer, were the only one who mattered in the digital rhetorical
          situation (<em>if it looks good for me in Dreamweaver or FrontPage</em>,
          so the logic goes, <em>it must look good everywhere for everyone</em>).
          In a time when screens range between postage-stamp-sized cell phones
          and 71-inch flat panel LCDs, it is lunacy to assume that what the producer
          sees is what everyone, indeed <em>anyone</em>, else sees. Thoughtful
          digital producers should be much more concerned about what audience
          members GET than what they SEE.</p>

        <p>What audiences should get is flexible, open discourse. The Web and
          even the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="external">Creative Commons</a> are
          efforts steeped in the promise of such openness. But a Creative Commons
          (CC) license that allows for derivative works of, say, a Web-available
          Flash movie is an oxymoron at best (just try to extract an image from
          a Flash movie). At worst, the CC license emphasizes gestures of openness
          over interrogating the materiality of technologies and their capacity
          to support derivative discourse.</p>
        <p>To genuinely make digital discourse friendly to derivative works,
          it needs to be much more flexible (cut and paste does not count). Ultimately,
          end users and their devices should be responsible for combining content
          of different media elements—not software or file formats like Flash,
          and really not producers, either. The producer’s responsibility is
          to reference and orchestrate elements that can be accessed in a combined
          or piecemeal fashion: only then is a CC derivative-works license viable,
          or even honest.</p>
        <p>Any given digital artifact needs to be constructed not as a final
          resting place for discourse, but as a pause in a stream of further,
          unfettered access. A Web page listing an organization’s members’ names
          and email addresses, for example, can be far more open through the
          use of <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="external">microformats</a>. Rather
          than cutting and pasting the contents of the page, or returning each
          time the page’s information is needed, a user can, via the presence
          of <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" rel="external">the hCard microformat</a> and
          a technology like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4106" rel="external">Operator</a>,
          import some or all of the membership’s contact information directly
          into her own email address book. Once email address books become microformat-friendly,
          the address book could query the URL containing the contact information
          and update entries automatically.</p>

        <p>Single-sourcing with lo-fi XML technologies and their microformat
          cousins is an unprecedented and unparalleled method to structure and
          openly share content. But dependence on WYSIWYG software has kept producers
          in our field and elsewhere largely ignorant of XML. Even the XML backbone
          to OpenOffice.org’s implementation of the Open Document Type (ODT)
          format is a limited use of XML. OpenOffice.org (OOo) appears to do
          to XML what FrontPage and Dreamweaver have done to HTML: hacking up
          the language to accommodate visual choices (XML is a structural, not
          visual, markup language), and needlessly complicating what ought to
          be human-readable code into something meaningful only to machines.</p>
        <p>Producers command lo-fi technologies at the code level not in service
          to machines, but in service to other human beings whose specific technology
          access and physical ability are ultimately unknowable.</p>

        <p>There is no better way to lose the good will of audience members than
          to bombard them with a series of messages demanding the installation
          or upgrade of software and plugins or, worse, to announce that their
          equipment (and, perhaps, by extension, financial status or physical
          ability) is wholly inadequate and beyond the producer’s toleration.
          Even worse still may be no message or warning at all: just a blank
          screen or hopelessly malfunctioning digital artifact.</p>
        <p>End users must be accommodated and respected, even at the expense
          of the producer’s ultimate vision for a digital artifact. Yet it is
          often producers who are, or ought to be, begging for forgiveness (readers
          just go elsewhere): posting unusual file types to email discussion
          lists, creating Web pages whose hyperlinks only function in Internet
          Explorer, building Flash movies when XHTML and CSS would more than
          suffice.</p>
        <p>Producers deserve no forgiveness for their technological shortcomings
          or ignorance. None. A poor technological choice that denies access
          to anyone, for any reason, is ultimately a rhetorical problem—particularly
          when there are lo-fi technologies, like valid XHTML, that inherently
          address issues of access. The time has come to hold our colleagues
          and students accountable for their technological choices just as they
          would be held accountable for any other rhetorical choice.</p>

        <p>This is not about elitism; it is about raising our expectations of
          one another to embrace and take responsibility for <em>all</em> of
          the rhetorical concerns that comprise the digital medium—not just those
          that are easy, obvious, or convenient. So long as producers are relieved
          of their responsibilities, either by their audience or by the false
          assurances of WYSIWYG software, digital production will only attend
          to the question of “How to do this?” when the question ought to be,
          “How to do this <em>best</em>?”</p>
        <p>Lo-fi production technologies are able to deliver artifacts that are
          editable everywhere, and accessible everywhere, too (at least to some
          extent). Rather than developing after-the-fact alternative content
          (e.g., to make up for a missing Flash movie), producing and inventing
          in lo-fi technologies addresses the essential need for users to access
          content regardless of their conditions, including physical ability.</p>
        <p>Producing accessibile digital artifacts is neither an end in itself
          nor a testament to the supremacy of technology over all other rhetorical
          concerns. Rather, accessible artifacts arise from the equal application
          of care and attention to detail that scholars, in particular, expect
          of content.</p>
        <p>Readers of accessible, lo-fi artifacts will appreciate not being told
          what they must do (even if they are left blissfully ignorant of the
          enhanced coolness they may be missing out on); and producers can develop
          content and ideas in far less taxing lo-fi environments (compared to
          Flash), in far more portable and extensible formats, like XML, with
          far greater confidence in audience access than WYSIWYG software could
          ever provide.</p>

          <p>This is progressive enhancement: it works for everyone, but users
            with modern browsers will see a more usable version. We are, in a
            way, rewarding them for choosing to use a good browser, without being

        <p>Ultimately, there are production problems that lo-fi technologies
          are not yet poised to solve: vector graphics (at least until the lo-fi
          SVG standard is natively implemented in Internet Explorer) and 3D-modeling
          are two examples. No browser has native support for sound or video,
          which are accessible only through media players and browser plugins.</p>
        <p>Even lo-fi typography solutions lag behind their hi-fi counterparts,
          like Flash (whose font-embedding capabilities alone drew many in the
          graphic design community away from HTML and CSS). Designing with pure
          CSS entails limiting oneself to fonts commonly available on most operating
          systems. While there are glimmers of hope that major Web browsers will
          enable <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten" rel="external">support
          for TrueType Web fonts</a> (fonts that can be accessed over the Web
          without requiring installation on an end-user’s computer, as in the
          case of basic TrueType fonts), for now the lo-fi-ish typography tool
          of choice is <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr" rel="external">Scalable
          Inman Flash Replacement</a> (sIFR, pron. “siffer,” currently in <a href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr3" rel="external">version
          3</a>). sIFR relies on the lo-fi technologies of plain text structured
          in XHTML and JavaScript and a small, empty Flash movie containing only
          the font a producer wishes to use on a given Web page.</p>
        <p>With sIFR, if a reader’s browser lacks or has disabled JavaScript
          or the Flash player, the lo-fi CSS styling or simple HTML text will
          be displayed instead: a dynamic (and unobtrusive) improvement over
          CSS <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/revised-image-replacement/" rel="external">image
          replacement techniques</a>—another typography work-around, but which
          fails in an imageless CSS-enabled environment.</p>

        <p>The use of any hi-fi technology should operate much like sIFR: taking
          some readily available media element or text, and enhancing it with
          extended functionality for properly equipped users—without punishing
          lesser-equipped users.</p>
        <p>Unobtrusive solutions like sIFR are rare, though. The videos on YouTube,
          for example, are dynamically loaded into a shell Flash movie that contains
          the controls for playing and pausing the video clip. However, if YouTube
          were to be fully unobtrusive, it would offer links in the HTML to movies
          in different formats (at least until an open, widely supported format
          is available; see “Insist on open standards and formats” below)—not
          just the proprietary Flash Video (.flv) format. In the absence of Flash
          or JavaScript, YouTube will not function, rendering all of its content
          inaccessible.</p>
        <p>A dynamic and unobtrusive lo-fi media player solution like Scott Schiller’s <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/" rel="external">SoundManager
            2</a> takes simple HTML links to sound files, and makes them playable
            on a Web page for users with both JavaScript and Flash enabled (in
            the absence of JavaScript or Flash, users are able follow the links
            and download the sound files for listening in their own media player).
            Users with Flash are rewarded with an enhanced experience; users
            without Flash are none the wiser, and can still experience the audio
            presented on the page—which is all that the page’s producer could
            have hoped for. In fact, users without Flash have the added advantage
            of being able to download the individual audio files, perhaps for
            loading onto an iPod or other portable audio player.</p>

        <p>Digital artifacts should outlast the software that played a role in
          their creation. Insisting on open standards and formats, not software
          packages, is the only way to make this happen.</p>

        <p>Software should not be selected based on its high-end features or
          the size of its installed user base in corporate settings. We should
          not trick ourselves into thinking we can better prepare students for
          the workforce by teaching exclusively the most commonly used word processor
          or page design software. Instead, we should provide students with a
          digital literacy that enables them to focus on the rhetorical situation
          of digital production, which includes familiarity with open standards
          and formats, and to command any production method, software-enabled
          or otherwise, that supports them.</p>
        <p>Despite all of the open standards for text and images listed above,
          it’s astounding that there are not yet open standards for sound or
          video. The Ogg media container and its Vorbis and Theora CODECs, for
          sound and video respectively, are both promising solutions (especially
          because they are the preferred media formats on Wikipedia, particularly
          the Wikimedia Commons). Unfortunately, at present, Ogg formats require
          CODECs to be downloaded for use within other media players, adding
          an extra step beyond downloading Windows Media Player, QuickTime, or
          other audio/video players. (However, there is talk of <a href="http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/06/firefox-3-to-feature-native-audio-video-support/" rel="external">native
          Ogg support within Firefox</a>, meaning that Firefox could play Ogg
          audio without an additional plugin. At present, Firefox is expected
          to couple this functionality with the multimedia-oriented <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/" rel="external">HTML
          5 Draft</a> specification, which is competing, somewhat, with the W3C’s
          more XML-like structure-oriented <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/" rel="external">XHTML
          2 draft spec</a>. For a simple overview of HTML 5, see <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/previewofhtml5/" rel="external">Hunt,
          2007</a>.)</p>
        <p>There are any number of venues to consult regarding language and format
          standards. Standards for languages are openly available from the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" rel="external">XML</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" rel="external">CSS</a>)
          and <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/" rel="external">ECMA</a> (most notably <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" rel="external">ECMAScript</a>,
          the standard version of JavaScript). But there are other standards,
          from character sets at <a href="http://www.iso.org/" rel="external">ISO</a> to <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/" rel="external">file
          formats and MIME/Internet media types</a> at <a href="http://www.iana.org/" rel="external">IANA</a>.
          And if all else fails, particularly regarding choices of single-media
          files, producers may wish to consult the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/" rel="external">United
          States Library of Congress’s developed and adopted standards</a>.</p>

        <p>Innovation in the digital medium is not to be found on the paved cow
          paths of point-and-click, template-driven, fill-in-the-blank WYSIWYG
          software. Indeed, much of the exciting work on the Web involves working
          beyond the relatively simple languages of XHTML and CSS; the Application
          Programming Interface (API) and the Integrated Development Environment
          (IDE) are where the real envelope-pushing action is. But without the
          kind of source literacy gained from basic languages like XHTML, members
          of our field and our students will be wholly unprepared to build or
          command APIs or function competently in IDEs.</p>
        <p>Source literacy holds the key not only to more sustainable and accessible
          digital discourse, but to our ability to substantively contribute to
          the many open-source projects, like Drupal, Moodle, and even Firefox,
          which would no doubt benefit from the expertise and values that members
          of our field have to share.</p>
