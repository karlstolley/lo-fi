  <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
  <p>
    Each act of digital production is an opportunity to shrug off the burden of opaque software and
    to focus instead on the medium of the production itself. Each act is therefore an invitation to
    embrace writing as digital expression’s central activity: Not gestures, not menus. Not visual
    interfaces or resource-intensive all-in-one software packages, which embed production knowledge
    so deeply and invisibly that it can no longer be acted upon or understood.
  </p>
  <p>
    In digital form, writing is nothing but strings of characters, endlessly and potentially
    losslessly manipulable under conditions that menu-driven graphical software short-circuits in
    the name of intuition and user-friendliness. More than any other mode of expression, writing
    demands revision. There is no hope of getting it right the first time. Or the second.
  </p>
  <p>
    When writers write and revise by hand to make digital things, they introduce a missing human
    element and human timescale into the process and the production. The tenuous distinction between
    natural and computer languages dissolves, revealing itself as a construct that thrives on and
    maintains fear and ignorance of many core affordances and constraints of the digital medium.
  </p>
  <p>
    People working in rhetoric, writing, and the humanities should long ago have come to know that.
    Yet far too many of them, and their students, surrender writing and its demand for sophisticated
    production knowledge to any interface that promises to make an author’s life easier. And they do
    so even to the exclusion of a more diverse audience, whose individual members differ widely in
    corporeal, cognitive, and technological conditions of access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Software and communications technologies that elevate ease over expertise are the culprits here.
    Those who teach have an even more pressing responsibility to learn and then engage students with
    digital approaches and technologies that students themselves would not likely discover
    independently. Students must be afforded the opportunity to write markup, programs, <abbr
    title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>, and commit messages in the same range of
    learning situations as they write essays and exams today. They must be encouraged, supported,
    and even joined by their instructors in failed first efforts. The richest learning experiences
    reveal how failure and crude initial work transform to something better only through ongoing
    research and revision.

  <h2>Lo-Fi Production Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    Lo-fi production technologies are stable and free: sometimes free as in beer; sometimes free as
    in speech; and sometimes, if not chosen only after careful research,
    <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1678/">free as in puppy</a>. Equally as important, lo-fi
    technologies are modular and swappable, and can be combined or replaced as needed. They consist
    of:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Plain text files</b> encoded according to the international Unicode standard</li>
    <li><b>Plain text editors</b> (Notepad++, TextWrangler, Atom, vim, etc.) that support syntax
      highlighting to make source code easier to read</li>
    <li><b>Human-readable, standards-compliant computer languages</b> for specific tasks such as
      markup, design, scripting, and programming (Markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, Python,
      Ruby, etc.)</li>
    <li><b>Single-media files</b> (image, audio, video) in open formats, preserved in a lossless
      state but presented in additional forms, sensitive to network conditions, screen density, and
      reader ability and preference</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    To better develop digital projects for a diverse, distributed audience and to collaborate with
    others, lo-fi production should be learned and developed in tandem with an essential stack of
    supporting technologies:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Unix-like operating systems</b>, particularly the many variants of Linux and BSD that
      comply to large degree with the group of IEEE standards known as the Portable Operating System
      Interface, or POSIX</li>
    <li><b>Version control</b>, sometimes called source or revision control, for recording the
      changes to a lo-fi project over time and coordinating the contributions of multiple people
      collaborating simultaneously in parallel; Git is one of the more well known version control
      systems, but there are many others</li>
    <li><b>Package managers</b> for installing any necessary software at the operating-system level
      and for installing libraries and frameworks in any scripting or programming languages in use
      for a project in (e.g., npm for JavaScript-based Node.js, or RubyGems for Ruby)</li>
    <li><b>Standardized TCP/IP-based network protocols</b>, ideally in encrypted forms, including
      mainstays such as HTTPS and SSH; most Unix-like operating systems ship with all of the
      developer tools necessary for spinning up network protocols for local development behind a
      network’s firewall, instead of on the open Internet</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Despite their humble, decades-old base technology (plain text and Unix, basically), thoughtful
    assemblages of lo-fi technologies are remarkably hi-fi. They are likely what power your favorite
    smartphone apps and make possible web applications that offer the same rich interaction as found
    in traditional desktop applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether or not you create your own digital projects using lo-fi technologies, you most certainly
    benefit from, consume, and make use of them. Their absence is more obvious when you run into
    trouble: a web browser complaining about a missing plugin, an email attachment that can’t be
    opened on a smartphone, or an older file that cannot be edited in the latest release of the
    software used to create it originally. Sometimes trouble presents itself as a piece of software
    that students must use in a specific version in order for classroom instruction to proceed as
    planned; the newer version might require a new set of instructional materials, next time around,
    just to keep current with a different interface.

  <h2>Lo-Fi is <abbr title="Learning, Openness, Flexibility, Iteration">LOFI</abbr></h2>
  <p>
    “Lo-fi” describes a limited set of production technologies that people creating digital work
    should strive to command. As an acronym,
    <abbr title="Learning, Openness, Flexibility, Iteration">LOFI</abbr> outlines four
    principles of digital production that are essential for the advancement, extension, and
    long-term preservation of accessible digital work:
  </p>

  <ul id="lofi-acronym">
    <li>
      <b>Learning</b>: Yes, all technologies and all acts of production require learning. Obviously.
      But lo-fi learning is deliberately sought out with each act of production. That is the only
      way it can be sought out, as the full range of problems comprising any consequential act of
      production is unlikely to be satisfactorily addressed by the content or timescale of any one
      course, book, or tutorial. Learning must both scale and transfer from individual lines of code
      to entire lifespans of digital production approaches.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Openness</b>: Direct engagement with source code and media elements is a hallmark of
      lo-fi production. All components of a digital work must be available for inspection,
      revision, and extension outside the scope of any one device, platform, or piece of production
      software and any one creator. Like learning, openness must scale across time and space,
      including especially customization and repurposing by readers and end-users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Flexibility</b>: Lo-fi production technologies are inherently limited: there’s nothing much
      to click or tap around on and discover. Flexibility emerges from the thoughtful application of
      lo-fi technologies, not from a feature set embedded in an interface. As primarily acts of
      writing, lo-fi production establishes research and imaginative problem-solving as the central
      means to reach diverse audiences equipped with an endless variety of conventional, mobile, and
      assistive devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Iteration</b>: The hefty investment in learning something new is rivaled only by the
      investment of time in creating the first draft of a digital project, regardless of how far
      short it falls of the idea that originally inspired it. This is the most elusive element of
      digital creation: revision without penalty. Although difficult to recognize on shorter
      timescales, a key benefit of lo-fi production techniques, supported especially by version
      control, is slow and steady improvement of existing work as well as experimentation and
      parallel, alternate approaches to production. (Emphasis on <i>slow and steady</i>; there is
      little to be gained from the adjective <i>rapid</i> that often modifies <i>iteration</i>.)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
     Whether or not you choose to embrace lo-fi technologies, lo-fi principles are a useful
     heuristic to evaluate the production technologies that you bring to your own digital work, and
     to that of your classroom if you have one. Of all the lo-fi principles, iteration is the most
     consequential: It emerges from the sustained pursuit of the other three&mdash;learning, openness, and
     flexibility&mdash;even as it ensures that the other three remain an integral part of digital
     production.

        It is alarming when software, commercial or otherwise, comes to signify entire digital
        genres. Compare the number of results in a search engine for <em>PowerPoint best
        practices</em> versus <em>slideshow best practices</em>. The results suggest that
        vendor lock-in has as much of a grip on how people talk about production as it does on
        what actually gets produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a software-independent, lo-fi alternative to PowerPoint:
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a>, CSS guru and design wizard,
        developed and
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/category/tech/s5/">released into the public domain</a>
        a <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">Simple Standards-based Slide Show System</a>
        (S5). Meyer’s system uses the lo-fi web languages of structural XHTML,
        media-specific CSS, and JavaScript to deploy slideshows. Unlike PowerPoint slideshows, which
        require either the PowerPoint software itself or the
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13">Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer</a>
        for optimal viewing, S5 slideshows function in any standards-compliant web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        But S5 is just a start. Even more feature-rich lo-fi projects have been developed, including
        Hakim El Hattab’s <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/">Reveal.js</a>, a slideshow
        framework that leverages CSS3 animations and an advanced JavaScript API on top of the same
        basic web languages as Meyer’s S5 to produce slideshows that are in many ways superior to
        PowerPoint. For example, Reveal.js supports
        <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#multiplexing">multiplexing</a>, which allows
        audience members to pull up the slideshow on their own devices. The slides advance
        automatically on each device as the speaker moves through the slideshow: a huge
        accessibility boost over forcing an audience to squint at distant projected slides.
        Additionally, unique URLs for each slide make it possible for someone providing live
        social-media coverage of a talk to share pointers to specific slides. Formal citation
        benefits as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lo-fi systems like S5 and Reveal.js are well suited to the rhetorical situation of the
        slideshow, which shares with all digital productions a defining characteristic:
        uncertainty. Slideshows are commonly projected on unfamiliar computers (often, it seems,
        with dubious maintenance records) that a speaker might have access to only shortly before
        speaking. Will that computer have PowerPoint installed? The right version of PowerPoint, at
        that? If not, will the logged-in user have sufficient privileges and a network connection to
        download the PowerPoint viewer? If all else fails, will a reasonably competent IT person be
        present to step in and help?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such problems, rooted in the inflexible digital materiality of the PowerPoint file itself,
        are easily avoided by lo-fi alternatives like S5: Even if the computer runs an outmoded
        browser (and what computer doesn’t have a browser installed?), S5, Reveal.js, and other well
        constructed lo-fi slideshows will operate more or less as planned while remaining editable
        in any text editor available. Speakers can even keep their slideshow and a
        <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">portable version of Firefox</a>
        on a USB drive, should Internet access be sketchy or fail outright.
      </p>
      <p>
        As that simple example shows, looking beyond the apparent inevitability of software like
        PowerPoint brings the aims of the digital genre itself into focus. It invites a more
        flexible, rhetorical approach to production than focusing on the features and limitations of
        a given piece of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the classroom, software should therefore not be selected based on its high-end features
        or the size of its installed user-base in corporate settings. Instructors should resist
        assuming that they better prepare students for the workforce by teaching exclusively the
        most commonly used word processor or page-design software whose interfaces are wildly
        unstable and intrude upon thinking deeply about production problems. Those who teach should
        instead lead students in working through approaches and technologies that foreground the
        rhetorical situation of digital production, especially the uncertainty that software like
        PowerPoint attempts to paper over. Rhetorically focused instruction establishes familiarity
        with the affordances and constraints of open standards and formats and admits of the many
        uncertain and unknowable factors that determine how a digital artifact will be accessed and
        displayed. Yet inspiring examples like Reveal.js demonstrate how rewarding and liberating it
        is to learn to command open technologies through written language.

      <p>
        Too many software programs create roach motels for content and information: The data
        checks in via File &gt; Import, or a file-upload dialogue box on a web application, but it
        never checks out. Such digital artifacts&mdash;the PowerPoint, the PDF, the word-processor
        document&mdash;are only marginal improvements over the entrapped quality of analog, print
        information. In many ways, such as non-negotiable dependence on a specific piece of software
        to view the artifact, software programs are actually steps backward from the comparatively open access
        that books and other printed matter provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The author-privileged focus of closed, roach-motel formats and WYSIWYG software is explicit
        in the latter's acronym: What YOU See is What YOU Get. As though YOU, the author, were the only one
        who mattered in the digital rhetorical situation. <em>If it looks good for me in Dreamweaver
        or my desktop browser</em>, so the logic goes, <em>it must look good everywhere for
        everyone</em>. At a time when screens range between postage-stamp-sized wearables and
        88-inch ultra-high-definition televisions, it is lunacy to assume that what the creator of a
        work sees is what everyone, or really <em>anyone</em>, sees. The tireless pursuit of a 1:1
        match between what appears on screen for an author and what's received, eventually, by a
        reader is a pernicious artifact of print culture deeply embedded into the interfaces of even
        early page-design software.
      </p>
      <p>
        People creating digital work for others should be far more concerned about what the audience
        <em>gets</em> than what it <em>sees</em>. What audiences should get is flexible, open
        formats. Writing: the luxury of well-crafted source code that the reader’s own device will
        render, to the greatest extent of its capability. The Web and even the
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> are efforts steeped in the
        promise of openness. But a Creative Commons (CC) license that allows for derivative works
        of, say, a Web-available PDF is an oxymoron at best: just try to extract an archive-quality
        image from a PDF file, or to listen for coherence as an audio screen-reader meanders
        unpredictably through a multi-column document. In those cases, the CC license emphasizes
        gestures of openness over careful preparation of digital artifacts with a genuine capacity
        to support derivative works, or even basic device- and ability-neutral access.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make digital projects genuinely friendly to derivative works, it needs to be maximally
        flexible (cut and paste does not count). A version-control repository containing the lo-fi
        elements of plain-text and single-media files, and their history, is the most generous
        expression of flexibility. It recognizes that an unknowable group of users and their devices
        should be able to, one day, rework the content of different media elements. The repository
        serves to recognize that there may be other platforms and production approaches in the
        future. The digital creator’s responsibility is to reference and orchestrate elements that
        can be accessed in a combined or piecemeal fashion: only then is a CC derivative-works
        license viable, or even honest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any given digital artifact needs to be constructed not as a final resting place for an idea
        or some information, but as a pause in a stream of further, unfettered access and revision.
        A web page listing an organization’s members’ names and email addresses, for example, can be
        made more open through the use of <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>.
        Rather than cutting and pasting the contents of the page, or returning each time the page’s
        information is needed, a user can detect the presence of
        <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card">the h-card microformat</a> with a
        <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#Implementations">parser for microformats</a>.
        It would then be possible to import some or all of the membership’s contact information
        directly into her own email address book. Should electronic address books become
        microformat-aware, the address book could query the URL containing the contact information
        and update entries automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preparing rich, user-manipulable data using techniques such as microformats, which are now
        part of the
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html">microdata portion of the HTML specification</a>,
        is a unique, lo-fi method to structure and openly share content. But dependence on WYSIWYG
        software has kept people largely ignorant of data serialization and semantics supported by
        languages like XML and JavaScript Object Notation (<a href="http://www.json.org">JSON</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital works should long outlast the software that played a role in their creation.
        Insisting on open standards and formats, not software packages, from the moment of
        authorship to the moment of reader access is the only way to make that happen. People
        creating digital work should value the command of lo-fi technologies at the code level: not
        in service to machines, but in kindness to other human beings whose specific technology
        access and physical ability are ultimately unknowable.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are any number of venues to consult for authoritative guidance on language and format
        standards. Standards for languages are openly available from the
        <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>
        (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>) and
        <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA</a> (most notably
        <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</a>,
        the standard version of JavaScript). There are other standards, from character sets at
        <a href="http://www.iso.org/">ISO</a> to
        <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">file formats and MIME/Internet media types</a>
        at <a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a>. Regarding choices of single-media files, it is
        worthwhile to consult a library-backed resource such as the
        <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/">United States Library of Congress’s developed and adopted standards</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But few people doing lo-fi production will need to consult the specifications directly in
        the normal course of production. Community-maintained documentation, such as the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a> and
        <a href="http://www.webplatform.org/">WebPlatform.org</a>, are better organized and
        presented with essential information relevant to many production problems.

          When one steps back from the marketplace, things can be seen in a different light. While
          time passes on the surface, we may dive to a calmer, more fundamental place. There, the

        Acts of digital production should establish conditions for learning beyond pointing and
        clicking through an arbitrary set of menus and dialog boxes. Point-and-click, GUI-driven
        WYSIWYG production approaches are not extensible: Beyond exposure to certain visual
        conventions, learning to navigate Microsoft Word or Google Docs has little transferability
        to future efforts even in other GUI-driven software like Photoshop, not to mention essential
        lo-fi languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expertise is the price to be paid for intuition and reflex, the two central benefits of well-designed GUI-driven production software. Together, intuition and reflex make for easy
        software that’s fun to use. There is no question about that. And when it comes to apps for
        personal use, from email and messaging to social networking and gaming, software absolutely
        should be intuitive and provide the kinds of interfaces and visual cues that make for
        reflexive, unstudied use, for users coming from more than a handful of particular cultural
        and socioeconomic backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that the market for GUI-driven software has conditioned people to expect the
        same ease everywhere. To be sure, there should be no need to write source code just to check
        email or to book a restaurant reservation online. But that does not mean that no occasions
        exist when writing source code is absolutely necessary. A lo-fi approach rejects intuition
        and reflex in exchange for the uncomfortable uncertainty and time-consuming struggles of
        research and learning. Intuition and reflex are only for today, for the person making
        something. What is being made, and for whom, are always different problems, project to
        project. Research-driven lo-fi production is not just about investigating the <em>how</em>
        of production that visual interfaces embed and make intuitive. Lo-fi production directly
        addresses essential audience-driven concerns of digital creation that are also the most
        stable and sustainable: the <em>what</em> and the <em>why</em>, under the human and
        technological constraints of <em>for whom</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lo-fi methods open access to the languages and methods of production obscured by and
        embedded in visual interfaces. Production approaches anchored to open, standardized
        languages have a longer shelf-life than those embedded in GUI-driven software. The essential
        properties of HTML 4.01 in 1997 are identical to HTML5 in 2016, but there is no penalty or
        accessibility cost associated with writing HTML 4.01 today. The same cannot be said for
        Microsoft Office 97 and its current version: As of December 2015, there are over five
        million Google results for <em>how to open a Word 97 document</em>. Word 97 knowledge is as
        defunct as the objects that it produced, which more than a handful of people have struggled
        to access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although languages, like software, are subject to change in future releases, languages
        retain their essential character version to version. So too do the essential text-based
        interfaces of command-line applications on Unix-like operating systems: <code>cd; ls</code>
        will always change to your home directory and then list its contents. The markup languages
        SGML, HTML, and XML look and behave very similarly, for another example, despite the fact
        that SGML was developed in the 1960s and
        <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16387">standardized in 1986</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/hist2002">XML in 2000</a>. To learn any
        one of those languages is to have learned the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or more accurately, to learn any one markup language is to learn <em>about</em> the general
        idea of markup languages. It is foolish and certainly difficult to confidently write more
        than a few lines of HTML without referring to a solid reference, such as
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">the HTML element reference</a>
        maintained by the Mozilla Developer Network. Consulting and researching an element reference
        does more than explain what to type: It opens up ways of thinking about individual elements
        and their histories as well as their ongoing development. Research transforms production,
        making it as much an object worthy of study as the content it’s meant to convey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning builds on research, but the deeper learning of the greatest value requires
        stability. The stability of computer languages is due, in part, to common ancestors. For
        example, there are few scripting or programming languages that are not at least influenced
        by C. Learning one language on a family tree is inherently preparation to learn others. Even
        languages that are essentially unrelated (say, CSS and PHP, or HTML and Ruby) share much of
        the same meta vocabulary and concepts: lines of styles in CSS are <em>terminated</em> with
        a semicolon as are lines of PHP code. <em>Nested</em> tags in HTML resemble statements that
        are <em>nested</em> in Ruby. Prepared with that sort of vocabulary, people engaged in lo-fi
        production can develop mental models for how languages operate in conveying a particular
        idea in service to diverse audiences. They can leverage exacting Google searches to research
        and solve a wide range of production problems. They can, with the time and patience, achieve
        the highest levels of thinking valued in the humanities and other academic disciplines:
        theory, reached via abstraction and contemplation based on studied, deliberate experience.

        There is no better way to lose the good will of audience members than to bombard them with a
        series of messages demanding the installation or upgrade of software and plugins or, worse,
        to announce that their equipment (and, perhaps by extension, financial status or physical
        ability) is wholly inadequate and beyond toleration. Worse still is no message or
        warning at all: just a blank screen or hopelessly malfunctioning digital artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        A poor technological choice that denies access to anyone, for any reason, is ultimately a
        rhetorical problem—particularly when there are lo-fi technologies, like web standards, that
        address issues of access by design. Lo-fi production approaches afford an opportunity to
        raise our expectations of one another and to research and assume responsibility for
        <em>all</em> of the rhetorical concerns that comprise the digital medium—not just those that
        are easy, obvious, or convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lo-fi production technologies provide a foundation for delivering artifacts that are
        editable everywhere, and accessible everywhere, too. But they still require a thoughtful
        approach: designing first for the most constrained users and devices. Without exception.
        Accessibility is not some drudgery to be filled in only after the rest of the work has been
        done.
      </p>
      <p>
        People with the most sophisticated whiz-bang production knowledge, or the most expensive
        GUI-driven software, are also typically privileged to enjoy the fastest computers, the most
        recent generation of smartphones, the highest-resolution displays, the speediest network
        connections, and the most generous mobile data plans. But that is not the way most of the
        world is equipped. In acts of production, it’s better to assume that <em>none</em> of the
        rest of the world is equipped that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make a habit of producing a single artifact across as many different computers and devices
        as you can get access to. Nothing will make you rethink your production approach more than
        30 minutes on a dilapidated hotel-lobby computer used mostly for printing boarding passes.
        Throw a different operating system into the mix by running Linux off of an external hard
        drive on your primary computer. Make sure it doesn't have your usual typefaces or software,
        then get to work. Make every word and every line of source code count. Make every byte of
        a media file work hard to justify the time and resources necessary to download it. And if it
        cannot, get rid of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a world-accessible draft, test it everywhere: the public library, the
        mobile-phone store, the big-box retailer’s electronics department. And not on the really
        expensive stuff, either. Choose the cheapest laptop loaded with the most awful bloatware.
        The mobile phone with the smallest, ugliest little display. Disable, if you can, the LTE
        internet connection to see the 2G world of the people who’ve already burned through their
        pitiful three-gigabyte LTE data allotment for the month, perhaps thanks to a monstrous PDF
        file someone sent as an email attachment without thinking for a moment what consequences
        that might have. Get a real, lived sense of just what it is that other people might see
        when they access the thing that you’ve created.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producing accessibile digital artifacts is neither an end in itself nor a testament to the
        supremacy of technology over human concerns. Rather, accessible artifacts arise from the
        equal application of care and attention to detail that is traditionally expected of content.
        That means accepting the gift that comes from designing first for the most constrained
        devices and users. Constraint is not a limitation on creative expression; it is a baseline
        experience that demands as much as possible from as little as possible. Constraints invite
        careful investigation as to what matters most, whether in terms of user-interface design or
        loading media elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is from that solid baseline that additional features and functionality can be added, in
        an unobtrusive way that benefits those who are able and can afford to experience them,
        without penalizing those who cannot. Readers of accessible, lo-fi artifacts will appreciate
        not being told what they must do (even if they are left blissfully, mercifully ignorant of
        the enhanced coolness they may be missing out on); and people producing well-researched
        digital work can develop content and ideas with far greater confidence in ethical audience
        access than WYSIWYG software will ever provide.

        It used to be necessary to employ Flash to handle audio and video or present web typography
        beyond commonly installed system fonts. But that’s no longer the case. HTML5’s
        <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags are now widely supported, as
        is the CSS <code>@font-face</code> property.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, that those technologies exist is very different from understanding their
        features and limitations, not to mention exactly how widely supported they really are on
        current and legacy browsers. (And if you want to lose all hope and an afternoon, read up on
        the state of CODECs and media containers for delivering video files across all browsers.
        It’s depressing. But the thing that will most help the situation improve is further research
        and involvement from a larger, more diverse group of people.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re using a hi-fi piece of production software that embeds videos in HTML, it may do
        nothing more than ask for the location of your video file. It’s not going to necessarily
        alert you to issues users might encounter, or provide fallbacks for users with older or less
        capable browsers. And if the software does provide a fallback, it might not be the kind of
        fallback you want to present. It might just be another error message and notice to upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those kinds of concerns illustrate why lo-fi production is so dependent on research, and why
        GUI-driven software that promises to deliver one-click solutions to those kinds of problems
        should be treated with suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t take much research to find hi-fi production technologies. They’re well marketed
        and have plenty of brand-name recognition. They come pre-installed, often in
        broken or incomplete form, on consumer PCs, and are likely on many of the machines in the
        computer labs at schools and universities around the world. They’re also on the computers
        found in most office cubicles, which more than any other scene of computing seems to be the
        primary inspiration for both campus and personal computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask someone why they chose a particular technology for a project, and you will often find
        one little feature driving the decision. It’s astounding, for example, to discover that
        people choose to set up WordPress to run a small website simply because they wanted a way to
        repeat the navigation across the four or five pages that made up the site. For that one
        feature, they pay the tax of securing a database connection and applying software updates
        for the life of the project, lest the infamous
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/search/pharma+hack">pharma hack</a> or one of its many
        variants compromise the site. Had such a small site been built with basic HTML, or a static
        site generator like Jekyll or Wintersmith, no updates beyond those routine to the web server
        itself would likely be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        On its face, something like WordPress looks lo-fi. WordPress is all open source, all built
        on a simple setup of lo-fi technologies: the LAMP stack, or Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
        But it’s actually the MySQL database that invites a closer look and further research. A
        database might be lo-fi on its surface, but a database is best employed only under one of
        two conditions, usually both: first, there must be far more records than can
        be reasonably handled by flat files (that is, a database record per page of a website,
        rather than an HTML file per page). Second, database-like things must routinely be done to
        those records: sorting, counting, joining, and so on, in the context of more read–write
        operations than can be handled by flat files. A five-page website that’s infrequently
        updated does not fit that bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kinds of research required for lo-fi production is always aimed at a particular problem.
        Maybe it’s how to handle templating in a lo-fi way: If a solution includes a database or an
        oversized code library, more research is needed. Or maybe, as in the earlier CSS
        <code>@font-face</code> example, it’s the problem of loading a custom typeface onto a web
        page. Which opens up questions like <em>Why that typeface?</em> And then <em>How to load the
        custom face?</em> And that in turn should open up an investigation to what the
        consequences are, both in terms of legality (font licensing is a particularly thorny issue)
        and user experience. Typefaces eat up bandwidth like any other media asset. Is it worth the
        potential expense, on metered connections, or the wait to load the typeface? Especially when
        adequate, if not perfect, typefaces may be readily available on the reader’s device? Then
        there are other considerations: Certain typefaces, particularly icon fonts, map letters and
        numbers to particular icons for ease of use, which may result in weird accessibility issues
        for users of screen-reading software. On certain displays, typefaces that have not been
        manually hinted may look just terrible, undercutting the very aesthetic that motivated
        loading a custom typeface to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
        In lo-fi production, every single feature and consequence is a potential avenue for
        research. Nothing, not even something as low-level as a typeface, should be mindlessly
        dropped in and glossed over. And particularly when only a hi-fi solution seems viable, there
        is always the need to push a little harder on the actual production problem, and research
        accordingly.

        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Next to the plain-text editor, there is no more important piece of software in a lo-fi stack
        than a version control system. It is the piece that makes experimentation possible, reduces
        the friction of collaboration across time, space, and platforms, and makes learning and the
        sorely lacking component of revision a central part of digital production.
      </p>
      <p>
        With minor variations, version control systems (VCSs) organize projects into
        repositories. The repository is both the files that make up the project, and their
        history. In some VCSs, that history is limited to a certain number of most-recent
        changes; on others, the repository’s history goes back to the very beginning of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is probably the most widely known VCS, thanks in no small part to GitHub, a code-hosting
        site based on Git that is in no way required for using Git itself. But there are many other
        version-control systems available. The best of them share with Git one primary feature, and
        that is that they’re fully distributed: Any one copy of the repository is independent from
        any other copy. That means work can go on uninterrupted even if you’re without an Internet
        connection, and it frees you to work however you please without having to make all of
        your work public. But when work is ready to be shared publicly or with a team of
        collaborators, the VCS steps in to assist in sharing that work, rather than inviting the
        clumsy intrusion of email attachments or generic cloud-storage services.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the non-negotiable qualities of lo-fi production is that a single project will be
        split over multiple files. Even a basic web page, for example, has an HTML file that might
        load multiple different CSS and JavaScript files as well as different images and other
        media, each in their own files. There are many benefits to that, although the obvious
        drawback is that a single change, such as rewriting the copy for a headline and restyling it
        in CSS for better readability, requires changes to multiple files. Using the file system as
        version control by creating a series of files like <code>index-old-01.html</code>,
        <code>index-old-02.html</code>, and so on, quickly falls apart when files need to reference one
        another through URLs or load or include statements. A good version control system takes that
        burden away from the file system, while having no problem at all with recording a single
        change across multiple files.
      </p>
      <p>
        But version control isn’t just for recording changes. Many version control systems act as
        development platforms not only to record changes, but to act on them. Git, for example,
        includes the ability to run scripts before and after certain actions. Pushing changes to a
        remote server can trigger a script that moves the updated files into place on a
        world-viewable web server. Rather than messing around with error-prone, bandwidth-hungry FTP
        software, a simple <code>git push</code> from the command line is all it takes to make the
        latest version of the site world-available. Projects like Capistrano add in their own
        advanced functionality on top of Git to handle more complex development stacks, which might
        include databases and other services that require configuration, maintenance, and restarts
        as part of deploying a project to a live web server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version control is also a huge asset to learning new languages and frameworks. Habitually
        creating repositories for working through examples in books and tutorials make it much
        easier to spot changes that might not directly be mentioned by the author. The use of
        branches also support exploratory changes that deviate from the book or tutorial’s advice.
        And that’s often where deeper learning can happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who teach, version control represents an essential, missing part of digital
        pedagogy. What matters in student work is not what the project is at any given moment from
        a first draft to a final project submission. What matters is what it was, and what it next
        became. In between those two points in time is where learning should take place. A student
        coming for help with a broken project that used to be working can, with the assistance of
        version control, trace the exact moment in time it ceased to function. The instructor in
        turn learns of a key piece of teaching that might have failed, or an object lesson to teach
        from in the future.
