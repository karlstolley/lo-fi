  <p>
    The time has come to reject expensive consumer and prosumer software that hinders the
    extensibility of digital discourse and limits digital production literacy to programs and file
    formats that are destined for disruptive upgrades or obsolescence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digital scholars in the loosely defined fields of rhetoric and composition, computers and
    writing, and technical communication should create free and open source artifacts that are
    software- and device-independent. Discourse posted on the open Web can hardly be considered free
    if access requires costly software or particular devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the literacies and language we develop through engaging in digital scholarship and
    knowledge-making should enable us to speak confidently, unambiguously, and critically with one
    another about the intricacies and methods of digital production.
  </p>
  <p>
    And as teachers, we should actively work to provide students with sustainable, extensible
    production literacies through open, rhetorically grounded digital practices that emphasize the
    <em>source</em> in “free and open source.”

  <h2>Lo-Fi Production Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    Lo-fi production technologies are stable and free: sometimes free as in beer; sometimes free as
    in speech; and sometimes, admittedly,
    <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1678/">free as in puppy</a>. They consist of:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Plain text files</b> encoded according to the international Unicode standard</li>
    <li><b>Plain text editors</b> (Notepad++, TextWrangler, Atom, vim, etc.) that support, at minimum, syntax highlighting to make source code more readable</li>
    <li><b>Human-readable, standards-compliant computer languages</b> for specific tasks such as
      markup, design, scripting, and programming (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Ruby,
      etc.)</li>
    <li><b>Single-media files</b> (image, audio, video) in open formats, preserved in a lossless
      state but presented according to limitations of network conditions, screen density, and user
      ability and preference</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    To best disseminate those artifacts for a world-wide audience and to collaborate with others,
    lo-fi production technologies are far easier to learn and develop on top of a basic stack of
    lower-level technologies:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Unix-like operating systems</b>, particularly the many variants of Linux and BSD that comply to large degree with the group of IEEE standards known as the Portable Operating System Interface, or POSIX</li>
    <li><b>Standardized TCP/IP-based network protocols</b>, ideally in encrypted forms, including mainstays such as HTTPS, SSH, and others; most Unix-like operating systems ship with all of the developer tools necessary for spinning up network protocols for local development behind your network’s firewall, not on the open internet</li>
    <li><b>Version control</b>, sometimes called source or revision control, for managing the changes to a lo-fi project over time as well as managing the contributions of multiple, simultaneous contributors working in parallel; Git is one of the more well known version control systems, but there are many others</li>
    <li><b>Package managers</b> for installing any necessary software at the operating-system level and for installing libraries and frameworks in any scripting or programming languages that you write in (e.g., npm for JavaScript-based Node.js, or Gems for Ruby)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Despite their humble, decades-old base technology (plain text and Unix, basically), thoughtful
    assemblages of lo-fi technologies are remarkably hi-fi. They are likely what power your favorite
    apps on your smartphone and make possible web applications that have virtually the same rich
    interaction as found in traditional desktop applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether or not you create your own digital artifacts using lo-fi technologies, you most
    certainly benefit from, consume, and make use of them. Their absence is more obvious when you
    run into trouble: a web browser complaining about a missing plugin, an email attachment you
    can’t open on your smartphone, or an older file that refuses to open on the latest release of
    the software used to create it.

  <h2>Lo-Fi is
    <abbr class="lo-fi" title="Learning, Openness, Flexibility, Iteration">LOFI</abbr>
  </h2>
  <p>
    “Lo-fi” describes a limited set of production technologies that digital creators should
    strive to command. As an acronym, <abbr class=”lo-fi” title=”Learning, Openness, Flexibility, Iteration”>LOFI</abbr> outlines four principles of digital production that are essential
    for the advancement, extension, and long-term preservation of digital expression:
  </p>

  <ul id=”lofi-acronym”>
    <li>
      <b>Learning</b>: Yes, all technologies and all acts of production require learning. Obviously. But this is learning that is deliberately sought out with each act of production. That is the only way it can be sought out, as the full range of problems comprising any consequential act of production are unlikely to be satisfactorily addressed by the content or timescale of a course, book, or tutorial. Learning must both scale and transfer from individual lines of code to entire lifespans of digital production approaches.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Openness</b>: Direct engagement with source code and media elements is the hallmark of lo-fi production. All components of a creative work must be available for inspection, revision, and extension outside the scope of any one device or piece of production software and any one creator. Like learning, openness must scale across time and space, including especially customization and repurposing by readers and end-users.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Flexibility</b>: Lo-fi production technologies are inherently limited: there’s nothing much to click or tap around on and discover. Flexibility emerges from the thoughtful application of lo-fi technologies, not from their feature set being embedded in an interface. As primarily acts of writing, lo-fi production techniques are unparalleled in asserting the value of research and imaginative problem-solving as the primary means to reach diverse audiences equipped with an endless variety of conventional, mobile, and assistive devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Iteration</b>: The hefty investment in learning something new is rivaled only by the investment of time in creating some new digital thing, regardless of how far short it falls of the  idea that originally inspired it. This is the most elusive element of digital creation: revision without penalty. Although difficult to recognize on smaller timescales, a key benefit of lo-fi production techniques, supported especially by version control, is slow and steady improvement of existing work as well as experimentation and parallel, alternate approaches to production.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
     Whether or not you choose to embrace lo-fi technologies, lo-fi principles are a useful heuristic to evaluate the production technologies that you bring to your own practice, and to your classroom if you have one. Of all the lo-fi principles, iteration is the most consequential: it emerges from the sustained pursuit of other three—learning, openness, and flexibility—while also ensuring that the other three remain an integral part of digital production.

          my work. I have concluded that the proper answer to the question is to counter-suggest

        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        As rhetoricians, we should resist allowing software, commercial or
        otherwise, to signify entire digital genres. But compare the number
        of results in a search engine for “rhetoric of PowerPoint” versus “rhetoric
        of slideshows.” The results are not encouraging—and suggest that “vendor
        lock-in” has as much of a grip on discourse as it does on scenes of
        production.
      </p>
      <p>
        But consider a software-independent, lo-fi alternative to PowerPoint:
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/" rel="external">Eric Meyer</a>, CSS guru and design wizard,
        developed and
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/category/tech/s5/" rel="external">released into
        the public domain</a> a
        <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/" rel="external">Simple Standards-based Slide
        Show System</a> (S5). Meyer’s system uses the lo-fi technologies of structural XHTML,
        media-specific CSS, and JavaScript (languages usually encountered on Web pages) to deploy
        slideshows. Unlike PowerPoint slideshows, which require either the PowerPoint software
        itself or the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=048DC840-14E1-467D-8DCA-19D2A8FD7485&amp;displaylang=en" rel="external">Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer</a> for
        optimal viewing, S5 slideshows function in any modern web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lo-fi system like S5 is well suited to the rhetorical situation of the slideshow, whose
        defining characteristic is uncertainty. Slideshows are commonly projected on unfamiliar
        computers (often, it seems, with dubious maintenance records) that a speaker might have
        access to only shortly before speaking. Will that computer have PowerPoint installed? The
        right version of PowerPoint, at that? If not, will the logged-in user have sufficient
        privileges and a network connection to download the PowerPoint viewer? If all else fails,
        will a reasonably competent IT person be present to step in and help?
      </p>
      <p>
        Such problems, rooted in the inflexible digital materiality of the PowerPoint file itself,
        are easily avoided by lo-fi alternatives like S5: even if the computer runs an outmoded
        browser (and what computer doesn’t have a browser installed?), S5 or other lo-fi
        slideshows will operate more or less as planned—while still being editable (something not
        possible in the bundled player-slideshow .pps format of PowerPoint). Speakers can even
        keep their slideshow and a
        <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" rel="external">portable
        version of Firefox</a> on their USB drives (or CD-ROMs, as some über-paranoid computer
        security policies restrict access to USB ports.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The move away from the seeming inevitability of software like PowerPoint or Flash brings
        the aims of the digital genre itself into focus: a much more flexible, rhetorical approach
        to production than focusing on the features and limitations of a given piece of software.
      </p>

      <!-- Cut material from old manifesto point 6. -->
      <p>
        Software should not be selected based on its high-end features or the size of its
        installed user base in corporate settings. We should not trick ourselves into thinking we
        can better prepare students for the workforce by teaching exclusively the most commonly
        used word processor or page design software. Instead, we should provide students with a
        digital literacy that enables them to focus on the rhetorical situation of digital
        production, which includes familiarity with open standards and formats, and to command any
        production method, software-enabled or otherwise, that supports them.

          <cite><span>Karen McGrane,</span> Content Strategy for Mobile</cite>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Too many software programs create “roach motels” for content and information: the data
        checks in (via File &gt; Import), but it never checks out. Such digital artifacts—the
        PowerPoint, the PDF—are only marginal improvements over the entrapped quality of
        analog/print information; and in some ways (e.g., dependence on a specific piece of
        software to view the artifact) are actually steps backward from the comparatively open
        access that books and other printed matter provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The selfishness of closed, roach-motel formats and WYSIWYG software is implicit in the
        acronym: What YOU See is What YOU Get. As though YOU, the producer, were the only one who
        mattered in the digital rhetorical situation (<em>if it looks good for me in Dreamweaver
        or FrontPage</em>, so the logic goes, <em>it must look good everywhere for everyone</em>).
        In a time when screens range between postage-stamp-sized cell phones and 71-inch flat
        panel LCDs, it is lunacy to assume that what the producer sees is what everyone, indeed
        <em>anyone</em>, else sees. Thoughtful digital producers should be much more concerned
        about what audience members GET than what they SEE.
      </p>
      <p>
        What audiences should get is flexible, open discourse. The Web and even the
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="external">Creative Commons</a> are efforts
        steeped in the promise of such openness. But a Creative Commons (CC) license that allows
        for derivative works of, say, a Web-available Flash movie is an oxymoron at best (just try
        to extract an image from a Flash movie). At worst, the CC license emphasizes gestures of
        openness over interrogating the materiality of technologies and their capacity to support
        derivative discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        To genuinely make digital discourse friendly to derivative works, it needs to be much more
        flexible (cut and paste does not count). Ultimately, end users and their devices should be
        responsible for combining content of different media elements—not software or file formats
        like Flash, and really not producers, either. The producer’s responsibility is to
        reference and orchestrate elements that can be accessed in a combined or piecemeal
        fashion: only then is a CC derivative-works license viable, or even honest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any given digital artifact needs to be constructed not as a final resting place for
        discourse, but as a pause in a stream of further, unfettered access. A Web page listing an
        organization’s members’ names and email addresses, for example, can be far more open
        through the use of <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="external">microformats</a>.
        Rather than cutting and pasting the contents of the page, or returning each time the
        page’s information is needed, a user can, via the presence of <a
        href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard" rel="external">the hCard microformat</a> and a
        technology like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4106"
        rel="external">Operator</a>, import some or all of the membership’s contact information
        directly into her own email address book. Once email address books become
        microformat-friendly, the address book could query the URL containing the contact
        information and update entries automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Single-sourcing with lo-fi XML technologies and their microformat cousins is an
        unprecedented and unparalleled method to structure and openly share content. But
        dependence on WYSIWYG software has kept producers in our field and elsewhere largely
        ignorant of XML. Even the XML backbone to OpenOffice.org’s implementation of the Open
        Document Type (ODT) format is a limited use of XML. OpenOffice.org (OOo) appears to do to
        XML what FrontPage and Dreamweaver have done to HTML: hacking up the language to
        accommodate visual choices (XML is a structural, not visual, markup language), and
        needlessly complicating what ought to be human-readable code into something meaningful
        only to machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producers command lo-fi technologies at the code level not in service to machines, but in
        service to other human beings whose specific technology access and physical ability are
        ultimately unknowable.
      </p>

      <!-- Cut material from old manifesto point 6. -->
      <p>
        Digital artifacts should outlast the software that played a role in their creation.
        Insisting on open standards and formats, not software packages, is the only way to make
        this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are any number of venues to consult regarding language and format standards.
        Standards for languages are openly available from the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>
        (e.g., <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" rel="external">XML</a>, <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/"
        rel="external">CSS</a>) and <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/"
        rel="external">ECMA</a> (most notably <a
        href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm"
        rel="external">ECMAScript</a>, the standard version of JavaScript). But there are other
        standards, from character sets at <a href="http://www.iso.org/" rel="external">ISO</a> to
        <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/" rel="external">file formats and
        MIME/Internet media types</a> at <a href="http://www.iana.org/" rel="external">IANA</a>.
        And if all else fails, particularly regarding choices of single-media files, producers may
        wish to consult the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/" rel="external">United States
        Library of Congress’s developed and adopted standards</a>.

        Acts of digital production should contribute to a deeper literacy than learning to point
        and click through an arbitrary set of menus and dialog boxes. Production literacies of
        point-and-click, menu-driven WYSIWYG software are not extensible: beyond exposing users to
        certain visual conventions (clicking a 3.5-inch floppy disk icon to save? really?),
        learning to navigate Microsoft Word has little bearing on future efforts in PhotoShop or
        Flash, much less CSS or MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adobe’s <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/adobeandmacromedia.html"
        rel="external">announcement</a> in spring of 2005 that it had purchased Macromedia—the
        company behind Flash, Dreamweaver, and other web production software—should have raised
        serious questions about producing and teaching too closely with particular software
        technologies, which can potentially evaporate as quickly as the ink dries on a corporate
        merger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet even adopting community-developed, open-source software is not necessarily the best
        response to the inherent instability of corporate software packages. True, the digital
        production literacies learned through open-source software, like
        <a href="http://openoffice.org/" rel="external">OpenOffice.org</a>, may be less prone to
        corporate mergers (though not necessarily corporate buyouts—witness
        <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html" rel="external">Sun
        Microsystems’ purchase of MySQL</a>, arguably the most popular open-source database). But
        community-developed software, like the corporate counterparts it often mimics, does not
        inherently provide for an “under the hood” literate encounter with the materiality of
        digital production languages and formats that lo-fi production methods do. Lo-fi operates
        at the material level of technology (code); WYSIWYG software (which describes Web editors
        as much as word processors, page design tools, etc.) keeps code and file formats at arm’s
        length by design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put another way, lo-fi production methods open access to the languages that visual
        interfaces for digital production often obscure: no matter what producers have to do to
        order Dreamweaver around, chances are that Dreamweaver will be spitting out the same (bad)
        code it always has.
      </p>
      <p>
        Production literacies anchored to open, standardized languages have a longer shelf-life
        than those tied to WYSIWYG software. Although languages, like software, are subject to
        future versions, languages often retain much of their essential character (e.g., SGML,
        HTML, and XML look and behave very similarly—despite the fact that SGML was
        <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16387" rel="external">standardized in 1986</a>, and
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/hist2002" rel="external">XML in 2000</a>). Code written in
        earlier versions of a language are often viable even after a revision of the language:
        producers can still write HTML 4.01, even though XHTML 1.0 is preferable. But forget about
        trying to pass a Word 1.0 document around.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stability of languages is due, in part, to common ancestors. For example, there are
        few scripting languages that are not at least influenced by C/C++. Learning one language
        on a family tree prepares one to more readily learn others. Even languages that are
        essentially unrelated (say, CSS and PHP, or HTML and Ruby) share much of the same meta
        vocabulary: lines of styles in CSS must be <strong>terminated</strong>, as must lines of
        PHP code. <strong>Nested</strong> tags in HTML resemble statements that are
        <strong>nested</strong> in Ruby. Prepared with this sort of vocabulary, digital producers
        can develop mental models for how languages operate. They can even leverage exacting
        Google searches to solve a wide range of production problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developer communities are the other component of a language’s stability. Multiple active
        developer communities surround any given open language: not just in the language’s use,
        but in its development (e.g., <a href="http://www.php.net/" rel="external">PHP.net</a>).
        As digital producers develop proficiency in a language, they may be able to shape the
        language’s future development. Such is the case with PHP, and in smaller, localized
        applications of languages, like microformats. Production literacies should aim to prepare
        digital producers to talk back to and shape the communities and technologies supporting
        digital discourse.

      <p>
        End users must be accommodated and respected, even at the expense of the producer’s
        ultimate vision for a digital artifact. Yet it is often producers who are, or ought to be,
        begging for forgiveness (readers just go elsewhere): posting unusual file types to email
        discussion lists, creating Web pages whose hyperlinks only function in Internet Explorer,
        building Flash movies when XHTML and CSS would more than suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producers deserve no forgiveness for their technological shortcomings or ignorance. None.
        A poor technological choice that denies access to anyone, for any reason, is ultimately a
        rhetorical problem—particularly when there are lo-fi technologies, like valid XHTML, that
        inherently address issues of access. The time has come to hold our colleagues and students
        accountable for their technological choices just as they would be held accountable for any
        other rhetorical choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not about elitism; it is about raising our expectations of one another to embrace
        and take responsibility for <em>all</em> of the rhetorical concerns that comprise the
        digital medium—not just those that are easy, obvious, or convenient. So long as producers
        are relieved of their responsibilities, either by their audience or by the false
        assurances of WYSIWYG software, digital production will only attend to the question of
        “How to do this?” when the question ought to be, “How to do this <em>best</em>?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lo-fi production technologies are able to deliver artifacts that are editable everywhere,
        and accessible everywhere, too (at least to some extent). Rather than developing
        after-the-fact alternative content (e.g., to make up for a missing Flash movie), producing
        and inventing in lo-fi technologies addresses the essential need for users to access
        content regardless of their conditions, including physical ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producing accessibile digital artifacts is neither an end in itself nor a testament to the
        supremacy of technology over all other rhetorical concerns. Rather, accessible artifacts
        arise from the equal application of care and attention to detail that scholars, in
        particular, expect of content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Readers of accessible, lo-fi artifacts will appreciate not being told what they must do
        (even if they are left blissfully ignorant of the enhanced coolness they may be missing
        out on); and producers can develop content and ideas in far less taxing lo-fi environments
        (compared to Flash), in far more portable and extensible formats, like XML, with far
        greater confidence in audience access than WYSIWYG software could ever provide.
